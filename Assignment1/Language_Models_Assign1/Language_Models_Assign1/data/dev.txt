 mr. <unk> told one person familiar with the new york exchanges during the search for a replacement that he was looking for a president who would be responsive to the needs of the membership and the board 

 mr. thompson first came to the exchange in N and has been executive vice president since march N 

 he previously held posts of senior vice president of compliance and senior vice president and general counsel 

 by contrast the comex in july imported a highly regarded outsider arnold f. <unk> as its president 

 mr. <unk> N was a senior officer of the philadelphia stock exchange and is considered a specialist in new financial products 

 mr. thompson is n't <unk> of experience with new products however 

 for the past two years he said he and the exchange 's research department have been working on the new natural gas contract seeking a good delivery site and studying the natural gas market 

 our members are eager to begin trading this contract so we expect no difficulty in attracting <unk> to the natural gas pit he said 

 the educational effort of teaching companies in the natural gas industry how to use the futures to hedge would have to continue for another a year or two he added 

 the merc 's extremely successful contracts in crude oil gasoline and heating oil have made it the largest futures exchange in new york and third behind the chicago board of trade and chicago mercantile exchange 

 in a recent interview mr. thompson said the biggest problem facing all commodity exchanges was one of image 

 earlier this year the u.s. attorney indicted N floor traders and one clerk at the two big chicago exchanges 

 federal authorities in new york started investigating exchanges in may though no <unk> have been handed down there 

 so far they have issued scores of <unk> some of which went to members of the new york merc 

 mr. thompson will have to face some of the consequences of those <unk> 

 in a recent general accounting office study the merc was found to have been the most <unk> in <unk> exchange rules 

 it <unk> the smallest number of <unk> of traders and fines of the four largest commodity exchanges studied over the past five years 

 it also had both the <unk> and least experienced investigators per million contracts traded 

 the merc received considerable criticism in N when it was discovered that its compliance director kevin p. conway who then was responsible for <unk> the exchange 's busy oil and metal pits was engaged in other personal business activities on exchange time including <unk> trips according to a new york merc report prepared last year 

 mr. conway is no longer at the exchange 

 we had a management breakdown in N in terms of compliance mr. thompson says 

 we recognized the problem and took care of it 

 he says that even if the natural gas contract boosts volume at the exchange strongly the N business plan calls for having adequate compliance people to ensure that exchange rules are being followed 

 for years the five new york exchanges have been talking about <unk> in various aspects of their business in order to improve the efficiency of their operations 

 <unk> there has even been talk of mergers between one or more exchanges 

 so far there is little to show for such efforts 

 mr. thompson believes the case for working together is stronger now than ever 

 the cost of competition has become extremely high he says 

 we must find ways to save money for the futures commission merchants who do business on our exchanges 

 he thinks that progress in cooperation can be made in areas where no vested interests have built up 

 one of those areas is the development of a hand-held electronic device that would permit floor traders to enter trades as they make them 

 the <unk> has recommended the creation of a system to record trade data so that an independent <unk> audit trail can be established to prevent customer fraud 

 the merc is now <unk> with the comex in developing such a device to provide such an audit trail 

 the chicago exchanges also are working on such a device 

 another major electronics problem faces mr. thompson the creation of a 24-hour trading system that can be used outside normal trading hours 

 in january the new york merc signed a letter of intent with the chicago merc as a preliminary step to joining their electronic system called <unk> 

 but in may the chicago merc said it was looking into creating a common system with the chicago board of trade and it suspended negotiations with the new york merc 

 mr. thompson says his exchange is n't waiting for the results of the chicago exchanges ' cooperation 

 it recently began a pilot program to test an electronic trading system called <unk> the automated trading system created by the international commodities clearing house 

 looking ahead to commodity markets this week 

 copper 

 michael <unk> metals trader for painewebber inc. in new york said there is good technical support between $ N and $ N a pound for december copper which ended friday at $ N a pound up N cents 

 he views the $ N to $ N range as a buying opportunity and considers the market <unk> 

 i think the market could pop up to the $ N to $ N level without too much difficulty he said 

 but he said it wo n't climb further and he expects it to remain in a trading range between $ N and $ N 

 he noted that the equity markets will set the tone for the industrial metals this week and traders should keep an eye on wall street 

 william <unk> research director for elders futures inc. in new york said for a rally to occur there must be demand from the far east 

 he added that talk of strike settlements at producing mines has been fully discounted 

 however to resume the bull trend according to mr. <unk> copper would have to close over $ N 

 he said there are two reports this week that might affect prices the purchasing managers report on wednesday and the unemployment report on friday 

 precious metals 

 friday 's strong price gains confirmed a turnaround in the precious metals markets according to painewebber 's mr. <unk> 

 most traders will be looking to buy on <unk> he said 

 he thought the moves in the metals last week were most influenced by the uncertainty in the equity and other financial markets 

 according to mr. <unk> floor traders say there is good support for december gold in the $ N to $ N per ounce area around $ N an ounce for december silver and in the $ N to $ N an ounce range for january platinum 

 william <unk> research director for elders futures inc. in new york said the price action for all of last week is the best he has seen on a weekly basis in more than a year 

 he said last week 's activity in gold could <unk> a move to $ N an ounce for the december contract 

 he also said traders should keep an eye on the stock market because if the stock market rallies that could <unk> trouble for the precious metals 

 he said traders should be on the <unk> for how metals producers react to this rally 

 i expect to see some selling but will they kill this one as they have every rally in the recent past by selling and <unk> in prices for their production 

 he noted that for the first time in months there was some light investor interest in the metals 

 grains and soybeans 

 prices this week will likely be dominated by reports on the progress of the corn and soybean harvest as well as by speculation about more purchases of u.s. crops by the soviet union 

 in recent weeks warm and dry weather has <unk> the midwest harvest and that is permitting farmers to rebuild the <unk> that were cut by the N drought 

 if the weather allowed farmers to work in their fields over the weekend many midwest grain elevators will probably sell futures contracts today at the chicago board of trade in order to hedge their weekend purchases from farmers 

 that selling of futures contracts by elevators is what helps keep downward pressure on crop prices during the harvest 

 traders will also watch for whether the soviet union continues its traditional fall buying of u.s. grain 

 so far this month the soviets have bought about N million metric tons of u.s. corn 

 there may be some activity in soybean prices this week as investors try to get rid of the contract for november delivery 

 investors usually do n't want to take physical delivery of a contract <unk> instead to profit from its price swings and then end any obligation to take delivery or make delivery as it <unk> expiration 

 employees of the globe and mail a thomson corp. newspaper in toronto voted to accept a tentative contract agreement saturday <unk> a strike at canada 's leading daily

 <unk> <unk> vice chairman of the southern ontario newspaper guild the union representing the workers said thomson made significant concessions in the final round of talks 

 in addition to wage increases the union negotiated improved vacation plans benefit packages and pension plans mr. <unk> said 

 he said more than N N of the bargaining unit voted in favor of the agreement 

 wall street is just about ready to line the <unk> <unk> with paper stocks 

 for three years a healthy economy and the <unk> effects of a weak dollar propelled sales and earnings of the big paper companies to record levels 

 as the good times rolled they more than doubled their prices for pulp a raw material used in all sorts of paper to $ N a metric ton this past spring from $ N a ton at the start of N 

 but now the companies are getting into trouble because they <unk> a record expansion program while they were raising prices sharply 

 third-quarter profits fell at several companies

 robert <unk> of duff & phelps sees <unk> stock prices falling N N to N N in N perhaps N N if there 's a recession 

 paper companies concede that business has been off recently 

 but they attribute much of the weakness to customer inventory reductions 

 generally they maintain that barring a recession and a further strengthening of the dollar against foreign currencies the industry is n't headed for a prolonged slump 

 it wo n't be an <unk> drop a weyerhaeuser spokesman says

 a <unk> spokesman referred to a speech by chairman john <unk> in which he said that markets generally are stable although some risk of further price deterioration exists 

 stone container chairman roger stone said that unlike for some other paper products demand for stone 's principal commodity <unk> <unk> remains strong 

 he expects the price for that product to rise even more next year 

 <unk> container said analysts are skeptical of it because it 's carrying a lot of debt 

 champion international said we 've gotten our costs down and we 're better positioned for any cyclical downturn than we 've ever been 

 louisiana pacific and georgia pacific said a number of other analysts are recommending them because of their strong <unk> business 

 federal paper board said we 're not as exposed as the popular perception of us 

 the company explained that its main product <unk> <unk> which goes into some advertising materials and white boxes historically does n't have sharp price swings 

 because the stock prices of some paper companies already reflect an expected profit slump painewebber 's mr. ross says he thinks that next year the share prices of some companies may fall at most only N N to N N 

 a company such as federal paper board may be overly discounted and looks <unk> to him he says though he is n't yet recommending the shares 

 wall street is n't avoiding everything connected with paper 

 mr. <unk> recommends <unk> explaining that it is virtually the sole major paper company not <unk> a major capacity expansion and thus should be able to lower long-term debt substantially next year 

 a <unk> spokesman said the company expects record earnings in N and we 're still pretty bullish on N 

 the analysts say their gloomy forecasts have a <unk> side 

 some take a warm view of <unk> paper companies which buy pulp from the commodity producers and should benefit from the expected declines in pulp prices 

 estimates on how much pulp prices will fall next year currently run between $ N and $ N a metric ton 

 analysts agree that the price drop should especially benefit the two big tissue makers scott paper and <unk> 

 a spokesman for scott says that assuming the price of pulp continues to soften we should do well 

 <unk> 's inc. said it will report a write-off of $ N million or seven cents a share for its fourth quarter ended yesterday

 in addition the effective interest rate on the $ N million of total remaining bank debt after the restructuring is N N 

 the combined effect of these changes is expected to save the company about $ N million in interest expenses next year or six cents a share

 nissan motor co. expects net income to reach N billion yen u.s. $ N million in its current fiscal year up from N billion yen in the previous year <unk> kume president said 

 mr. kume made the earnings projection for fiscal N ending next march N in an interview with u.s. automotive writers attending the tokyo motor show 

 the executive said that the anticipated earnings increase is fairly modest because nissan is spending heavily to bolster its dealership network in japan and because of <unk> fluctuations 

 during the next decade mr. kume said nissan plans to boost overseas vehicle production sufficiently to account for a majority of sales outside japan 

 last year mr. kume said nissan exported slightly over one million vehicles and produced N cars and trucks at its factories in north america europe and australia 

 but by N he added nissan will build one million vehicles a year outside japan or sufficient to equal exports 

 by the end of the 1990s he said we want to be producing roughly two vehicles overseas for every vehicle that we export from japan 

 that will involve a substantial increase in overseas manufacturing capacity he acknowledged but did n't provide specific details 

 national intergroup inc. said it expects to report a charge of $ N million related to the sale of its aluminum unit 's <unk> division for the third quarter 

 the company said it has agreed to sell the <unk> division for $ N million to <unk> werner co. a closely held firm based in greenville pa 

 the charge is offset by an after-tax gain of about $ N million in the quarter from the previously announced pact to sell national aluminum 's rolling division 

 national intergroup in the year-ago third quarter earned $ N million or N cents a share including a gain of $ N million from the sale of a steel tube company

 the municipal bond market is bracing for tough times through the end of the year as it struggles to absorb an <unk> of bonds and two of its best customers turn into sellers 

 commercial banks and property\/casualty insurers which together own about N N of all municipal bonds have been <unk> their securities for weeks 

 last week traders said there were three institutional sellers for every buyer 

 every day we 're getting new bid lists from would-be sellers one trader said 

 most dealers can not continue to absorb this supply 

 as a result yields on long-term <unk> bonds now stand at about N N of long-term treasury yields the highest such level in more than two years 

 there is incredible negative psychology building in the market said <unk> <unk> a vice president at merrill lynch & co 

 people are very concerned about who is going to step up to the plate and buy municipal bonds in the absence of institutional buyers 

 the yield on a group of N revenue bonds compiled by the bond buyer a trade publication now exceeds N N 

 at this week 's new york city bond sale traders expect yields on the 20-year new york bonds to nearly match the N N yield on 30-year treasury bonds 

 for an investor in the N N federal tax <unk> N N tax-free is the same as N N on a taxable investment 

 that 's a <unk> yield nearly three percentage points more than the current yield on 30-year treasury bonds 

 how quickly things change 

 this past summer investors ' appetite for municipal bonds seemed <unk> 

 individuals eager for tax-free income drove up bond prices making state and local government debt one of the <unk> types of fixed-income investments during the period 

 but while analysts say that municipal bonds still offer good value you would n't know it by the way institutional investors are rushing to dump their holdings 

 bond market analysts say the institutional selling was triggered by several factors 

 big banks such as chemical bank and chase manhattan which have been taking heavy charges to expand their third world loan-loss reserves are n't looking for tax-exempt income 

 we do n't need the shelter of tax-free bonds said a spokeswoman at chemical 

 in recent weeks traders said chemical has sold more than $ N billion of tax-free bonds 

 the spokeswoman confirmed that the bank has significantly reduced its <unk> holdings but could n't immediately confirm the amount 

 insurance companies are rushing to sell before the end of the year when some of their tax benefits associated with municipal bonds will be phased out 

 there is speculation that property\/casualty firms will sell even more <unk> as they scramble to raise cash to pay claims related to hurricane hugo and the northern california earthquake 

 fundamental factors are at work as well 

 <unk> bond holders are worried about the impact of a slowing economy on tax revenue at a time when many state and local governments already face budget deficits and huge spending needs 

 the recent natural disasters and the need of many other cities to rebuild crumbling infrastructure suggests that supply of new issues will continue to rise sharply even as demand <unk> off 

 there is just so much going on that it 's difficult to pick just one factor that 's driving the market said ronald ian heller vice president at first chicago capital markets inc. a subsidiary of first chicago corp 

 some of the recent selling could actually be considered a positive sign 

 mutual funds for example are said to be selling existing municipal bonds to raise cash to buy new issues 

 because municipal bonds yields have risen at a time when interest rates generally have fallen some portfolio managers are assuming that bonds bought now will appreciate in value as the municipal bond market <unk> 

 ms. <unk> believes that the mutual funds are selling <unk> bonds that have a negative <unk> those that have <unk> in price slowly relative to the decline in interest rates 

 such bonds she says are those that are <unk> their call date 

 but traders said the market 's tone could pick up this week if new york city 's $ N million bond offering goes well 

 the offering will include $ N million of 20-year tax-exempt bonds and $ N million of taxable bonds 

 a few weeks ago new york sold $ N million of <unk> 

 new york city bonds have been beaten down for three straight weeks 

 on friday some issues fell nearly one point or close to $ N for each $ N face amount 

 the sell-off in new york city bonds was triggered by concerns about the city 's financial health and political uncertainty in view of the impending mayoral election 

 the city 's economy is growing weaker and expenditures are rising as tax revenue is falling 

 the city has issued so much supply recently that some people are getting a little concerned 

 they 'd like to see some other names in their portfolios said michael s. <unk> first vice president at shearson lehman hutton 

 but he thinks investors may be <unk> to the market 's problems 

 overall he says municipal prices are very cheap and represent an excellent buying opportunity 

 friday 's market activity 

 treasury bonds fell sharply on confusion about this week 's treasury debt auction and rumors that a major japanese investor was unloading large amounts of long-term bonds 

 the treasury 's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of N N down nearly N point from thursday or about $ N for each $ N face amount 

 the issue 's yield rose to N N from N N 

 late thursday the treasury said it needed to raise $ N billion quickly and would do so by issuing new securities this week 

 credit market analysts expected the treasury to cancel today 's three-month and six-month sale and to sell $ N billion of cash management bills 

 instead the treasury announced it would sell $ N billion of <unk> cash management bills today and said that the weekly sale of $ N billion of three-month and six-month bills will take place today as usual but the sale will settle tomorrow instead of thursday 

 by moving the settlement date ahead the treasury can raise money under the $ N trillion debt ceiling that is in effect through tomorrow after which it <unk> to $ N trillion 

 the market also was hurt by rumors that nippon kangyo <unk> a japanese brokerage firm was unloading some of the 30-year bonds it recently purchased 

 one dealer said the talk was that the firm sold about $ N million of bellwether 30-year bonds 

 the firm is thought to have purchased up to $ N billion of 30-year bonds in a buying spree on wednesday and the previous thursday 

 dealers say the firm apparently has wanted to <unk> its recent buying and subsequent selling of 30-year bonds by using <unk> <unk> securities corp. as a broker 

 <unk> provides price quotes to telerate systems inc. a widely used electronic system 

 nippon kangyo 's moves <unk> traders and created confusion among potential investors many of whom decided to stay out of the market 

 as a result of its large-scale buying some analysts now say that liquidity or the ability to easily buy and sell has been <unk> in the benchmark treasury bond issue 

 in other markets 

 the junk bonds of rjr nabisco inc. rallied friday on news that the company is selling its candy bar brands to nestle foods corp. for $ N million

 mr. whittle said that so far three of the six schools that carried the program in a <unk> test last spring have <unk> to the program 

 one of the test schools <unk> high school in cincinnati rejected the project 

 john <unk> associate director of communications for cincinnati public schools said channel one was rejected because students watching the program did n't fare particularly better on a <unk> current events <unk> than a control school without the program and school <unk> were almost unchanged during the period when the program was being aired 

 the number of correct responses was N N on the test and school <unk> did n't change much said mr. <unk> 

 the pilot program was received well by teachers and students but there was n't reason enough to sign up 

 we even invited the public to stop by and see the program but there was n't much interest

 <unk> <unk> 

 twice in two weeks the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> ual buy-out <unk> the stock market 

 now stock prices seem to be in a general retreat 

 since <unk> at N on oct. N the dow jones industrial average has lost N points or N N closing friday at N down N 

 the number of issues falling on the new york stock exchange each day is <unk> the number of gainers 

 and the number of stocks hitting new lows far <unk> the number setting new highs 

 but why should an <unk> $ N billion leveraged buy-out deal shake the foundations of the entire stock market 

 opinions vary about how important the ual deal was to the market 's health but analysts generally agree that the market gyrations created as the ual plan <unk> revealed a fundamental change in investor psychology 

 if this had happened a few months ago when the atmosphere was still very positive it would n't have been greeted with anything like the impact it has had over the past two weeks says dennis <unk> a market strategist at kidder peabody 

 there are of course analysts who view the <unk> that briefly <unk> through investors on oct. N and again on oct. N as <unk> <unk> of good judgment that have only temporarily undermined a healthy stock market 

 sure price action is volatile and that 's scary but <unk> stocks are still a good place to be they suggest 

 the reaction to the ual debacle is <unk> says john connolly chief market strategist at dean witter 

 ual is a small deal as far as the overall market is concerned 

 the only way you can make it a big deal is to draw <unk> that just do n't make sense 

 he suggests for example that investors may have assumed that just because ual could n't get financing no leveraged buy-outs can get financing 

 carried even further some investors assumed that since leveraged buy-outs are the only thing <unk> up stock prices the market would collapse if no more lbos could be done 

 there will still be deals argues mr. connolly 

 there may not be as many and the buyers may not get away with some of the things they 've done in the past but deals wo n't disappear 

 he forecasts that the emphasis in mergers and acquisitions may soon return to what he calls strategic deals in which somebody is taking over a company not to milk the cash flow but because it 's a good fit 

 and even without deals mr. connolly figures the market would remain healthy 

 he notes for instance that there has n't been a merger or acquisition among the N stocks in the dow jones industrial average since N yet that average only three weeks ago hit a record high 

 those stocks are up because their earnings are up and their dividends are up he says 

 even the volatility created by stock index arbitrage and other computer-driven trading strategies is n't entirely bad in mr. connolly 's view 

 for the long-term investor who picks stocks carefully the price volatility can provide welcome buying opportunities as short-term players scramble <unk> to sell stocks in a matter of minutes 

 who can make the better decision the guy who has N seconds to decide what to do or the guy with all the time in the world he says 

 what on earth does the ual deal have to do with the price of <unk> which i was able to buy on oct. N at a very attractive price 

 kidder peabody 's mr. <unk> also sees some benefits to the stock market 's recent drop 

 we 've run into a market that was beginning to run out of steam and get <unk> he says 

 the balloon had been <unk> up so big that when somebody came along with a <unk> in this case the ual deal we got a little pop 

 the pop <unk> up investors who had been getting a little too <unk> says mr. <unk> 

 it provided an excuse for people to get back to reality and to look at the economic data especially the third-quarter economic numbers and to realize that we ca n't continue to <unk> over what is going on in the junk bond market 

 but he figures that at current levels the stock market is <unk> valued even with the economy obviously slowing 

 just because we 've got some <unk> back in the market does n't mean it 's going lower from here he says 

 the bottom line is that it 's healthy to have this kind of <unk> activity especially after a N N gain in stock values over the past N months 

 he 's now estimating that after a period of consolidation the dow jones industrial average will once again forge new highs 

 maybe maybe not 

 <unk> joseph cohen a market strategist at drexel burnham lambert is n't nearly so <unk> about the market 's chances of surging to new highs anytime soon 

 her view is that stock prices have three major <unk> merger and buy-out proposals earnings and the economic outlook 

 at current levels of economic activity and earnings stocks are fairly valued she says 

 but any chance for prices to surge above fair value lies in the speculation that <unk> a vigorous merger and buy-out business and ual has obviously put a <unk> on that 

 stocks are n't cheap anymore there have been some judicial and legislative changes in the merger area and all of this changes the <unk> of deals she says 

 i 'm not saying they 've stopped altogether but future deals are going to be structured differently and bids probably wo n't be as high 

 but that 's not the only problem for stocks 

 the other two <unk> earnings and the economic outlook are troubling too 

 <unk> is getting all the <unk> right now but these other things have been building up more gradually she says 

 third-quarter earnings have been generally disappointing and with economic data showing a clear slowing the outlook for earnings in the fourth quarter and all of N is getting worse 

 there are a lot more downward than upward revisions and it looks like people are questioning corporate profits as a means of support for stock prices she says 

 with all this can stock prices hold their own 

 the question is <unk> at this point she says 

 it depends on what happens 

 if the economy <unk> into a recession then this is n't a level that 's going to hold

 oil stocks escaped the brunt of friday 's selling and several were able to post gains including chevron which rose N to N N in big board composite trading of N million shares 

 the stock 's advance reflected ongoing speculation that pennzoil is <unk> a stake in the company according to dow jones professional investor report 

 both companies declined to comment on the rumors but several industry analysts told the professional investor report they believed it was <unk> that pennzoil may be buying chevron shares as a prelude to pushing for a restructuring of the company

 federal investigators have identified the problem in last july 's crash of a united airlines flight in iowa a structural flaw that developed during the making of a titanium engine disk 

 for several months officials at the federal aviation administration and the national transportation safety board have suspected that a <unk> flaw in the disk led to a crack that ultimately caused the <unk> engine to break apart in flight 

 the explosion sent <unk> of metal flying <unk> the <unk> 's <unk> or control systems and led to the crash that killed N people 

 but investigators could confirm their theory only after the recent <unk> of a big chunk of flight N 's <unk> engine from a <unk> near the <unk> city airport in iowa 

 the safety board will begin four days of hearings on the accident tomorrow in <unk> city 

 among the issues the board will examine is whether united airlines a unit of ual corp. should have been able to detect the cracks through maintenance checks 

 the engine involved was a <unk> made by general electric co 

 anthony broderick the faa 's acting executive director for regulatory standards and compliance said that recent tests of the failed engine disk indicate that a flaw known as hard <unk> occurred in the titanium during its production almost N years ago 

 he said there was n't any way to detect the flaw at that time and that the process has since been changed to decrease the chance that such flaws would occur 

 the faa already has ordered that all N disks made by the old process be removed from the planes and <unk> to an <unk> test in a <unk> chamber 

 such tests make the faa confident that a <unk> <unk> accident wo n't happen again said mr. broderick 

 a spokesman for ge said that the company has been working with the faa all along on this issue and will comply fully with the required <unk> 

 but he also pointed out that the recalls will have no impact on ge 's engine production 

 the <unk> series engines are n't being manufactured any more they are only being used in the <unk> series N planes currently in service he said 

 a frozen <unk> in <unk> may offer an important clue about whether the earth is warming <unk> 

 researchers at ohio state university and <unk> institute of <unk> and <unk> in china have <unk> samples of <unk> ice in <unk> and say temperatures there have been significantly higher on average over the past <unk> than in any similar period in the past N years 

 the ice samples are an important piece of evidence supporting theories that the earth has <unk> considerably in recent times largely because of <unk> in the air and will warm far more in the century ahead 

 a substantial warming would <unk> some of the earth 's <unk> ice <unk> raising the level of the <unk> and causing widespread flooding of heavily <unk> coastal areas 

 if you can use data to <unk> what happened in the past you have much more confidence in predictions for the future said <unk> thompson a research scientist at ohio state who <unk> for and <unk> the ice samples 

 to compare temperatures over the past N years researchers <unk> the changes in <unk> of two forms of <unk> 

 these measurements can indicate <unk> changes researchers said because the rates of <unk> of these <unk> atoms differ as temperatures change 

 analysis of ice from the <unk> ice cap a <unk> <unk> in <unk> N feet above sea level show that average temperatures were higher in N than in any other <unk> period since before the last ice age mr. thompson said 

 some climate models project that interior regions of asia would be among the first to heat up in a global warming because they are far from <unk> which moderate <unk> changes 

 but the <unk> samples are n't definitive proof that the so-called greenhouse effect will lead to further substantial global heating mr. thompson acknowledged 

 according to greenhouse theories increased carbon dioxide emissions largely caused by burning of fossil fuels will cause the earth to warm up because carbon dioxide prevents heat from <unk> into space 

 skeptics say that if that 's the case temperatures should have risen fairly <unk> over the past century reflecting the increase in carbon dioxide 

 instead the <unk> <unk> record shows increasing temperatures from N through the early 1950s <unk> temperatures from the late 1950s through the mid-1970s then higher temperatures again through last year 

 other <unk> data show similar <unk> swings 

 climate <unk> drastically due to natural causes said mr. thompson 

 but he said ice samples from peru <unk> and <unk> all show substantial signs of warming 

 <unk> corp. said its vice president for manufacturing resigned and its houston work force has been trimmed by N people or about N N 

 the maker of hand-held computers and computer systems said the personnel changes were needed to improve the efficiency of its manufacturing operation 

 the company said it has n't named a successor to ronald <unk> the vice president who resigned 

 its houston work force now totals N 

 cnw corp. said the final step in the acquisition of the company has been completed with the merger of cnw with a subsidiary of chicago & north western holdings corp 

 as reported cnw agreed to be acquired by a group of investors led by blackstone capital partners limited partnership for $ N a share or about $ N million 

 congress sent to president bush an $ N billion military construction bill that cuts spending for new installations by N N while revamping the pentagon budget to move more than $ N million from foreign bases to <unk> projects 

 the fiscal N measure builds on a pattern set earlier this year by house and senate defense <unk> committees and at a time of <unk> for the military and concern about the u.s. 's standing in the world economy overseas spending is most vulnerable 

 total pentagon requests for installations in west germany japan south korea the united kingdom and the philippines for example are cut by almost two-thirds while lawmakers added to the military budget for construction in all but a dozen states at home 

 the result is that instead of the pentagon 's proposed split of N between domestic and foreign bases the reduced funding is distributed by a ratio of approximately N 

 the extra margin for bases in the u.s. <unk> the power of the appropriations committees meanwhile lawmakers used their positions to <unk> as much as six times what the pentagon had requested for their individual states 

 house appropriations committee chairman jamie whitten d. miss helped secure $ N million for his state or more than double the pentagon 's budget 

 west virginia home of senate appropriations committee chairman robert byrd would receive $ N million four times the military 's request 

 tennessee and north carolina home states of the two democratic chairmen of the house and senate military construction <unk> receive $ N million or N N above the pentagon 's request 

 though spending for iowa and oregon was far less their increases above pentagon requests N N and N N respectively were much greater because of the influence of republicans at critical <unk> 

 the swift passage of the bill which cleared the senate and house on simple voice votes last week contrasts with the problems still facing a more <unk> $ N billion measure funding housing environmental space and veterans programs 

 by an N margin the senate approved the bulk of the spending friday but the bill was then sent back to the house to resolve the question of how to address budget limits on credit <unk> for the federal housing administration 

 the house democratic leadership could seek to waive these restrictions but the underlying bill is already under attack for excesses elsewhere 

 appropriations committees have used an <unk> of devices to <unk> as much as $ N billion in spending and as critics have <unk> to these devices the bill can seem like a <unk> <unk> trying to make it past ice and <unk> to reach safer winter <unk> 

 much of the excess spending will be pushed into fiscal N and in some cases is temporarily <unk> in <unk> accounts in anticipation of being transferred to <unk> areas after the budget <unk> is completed 

 for example a house-senate conference <unk> increased the national aeronautics and space administration budget for construction of facilities to nearly $ N million or more than $ N million above what either chamber had previously approved 

 part of the increase would provide $ N million toward ensuring construction of a costly solid <unk> facility in mr. whitten 's mississippi 

 but as much as $ N million or nearly N N of the account is marked for potential transfers to research management and flight accounts that are spent out at a faster <unk> 

 the bill 's managers face criticism too for the unusual number of conditions openly imposed on where funds will be spent 

 conservatives embarrassed by republican <unk> scandals at the department of housing and urban development have used the issue in an effort to shift blame onto a <unk> congress 

 hud secretary jack kemp backed an unsuccessful effort to strike such language last week but received little support from the white house budget office which wants to protect <unk> funding in the bill and has <unk> to turn its eyes from pork-barrel amendments 

 within discretionary funds for community development grants more than $ N million is allocated to six projects in michigan home state of a subcommittee chairman rep. bob <unk> 

 house speaker thomas foley won $ N for a project in his district in washington state and $ N million earmarked by sen. daniel inouye amounts to a business subsidy under the title <unk> sugar mills job <unk> 

 the powerful democrat had first wanted to add language <unk> environmental restrictions on two mills on the <unk> coast that are threatening to close 

 when this plan met resistance it was agreed instead to take money from hud to subsidize needed improvements in two settling <unk> for the mills which employ an estimated N workers according to mr. inouye 's office 

 dennis <unk> 's oct. N page-one article river of <unk> about the poverty along the mississippi <unk> <unk> memories of when my parents were <unk> in <unk> arkansas only a few miles from the river 

 although we were white the same economic factors affected us as affects the black people mr. <unk> writes about 

 fortunately an <unk> with a college degree bought a small farm and moved us N miles north to good schools and an environment that opened the world of opportunity for me as an <unk> 

 though i 've been <unk> with academic degrees and some success in the <unk> world i 've never forgotten or lost contact with those memories of the 1930s 

 most of the land in that and other parts of the delta are now owned by second third or fourth generations of the same families 

 these are the families who used and sometime abused their <unk> people who had no encouragement and little access to an education or training for a better life 

 following world war ii when one family with <unk> equipment could farm crops formerly requiring N families the surplus people were dumped into the mainstream of society with no social security no skills in the workplace no hope for their future except welfare 

 and today many of their children <unk> and <unk> remain on welfare 

 in the meantime the <unk> continue receiving generous subsidies that began during new deal days 

 or those who choose not to farm can lease their <unk> and crop <unk> for <unk> sums 

 farmers in the midwest and other areas have suffered but those along the mississippi continue to <unk> with holdings that were built with the sweat of men and women living in economic <unk>

 because the cycle of poverty along the lower mississippi goes back so many generations breaking this cycle will be next to impossible 

 <unk> the cycle appears not as waves but as a downward <unk> 

 yet the evidence that we have not hit bottom is found in the fact that we are not yet helping ourselves 

 the people of the delta are waiting for that big factory to open river traffic to increase government spending to fund <unk> programs or public schools to educate <unk> students 

 because we refuse to face the tough answers the questions continue as <unk> for the commissions and committees for the media and politicians 

 <unk> <unk> does not lend itself to solving the problems of <unk> <unk> pregnancy or lack of parental support or <unk> 

 does the delta deserve government help in attracting industry when the majority of residents black and white do not realize <unk> <unk> potential employers 

 should we focus on the region 's <unk> rate when the <unk> <unk> and the school boards <unk> and legislators prohibit schools from teaching the two ways <unk> or <unk> of <unk> <unk> pregnancy

 poverty is only two blocks from president bush 's residence 

 for years we tried to ignore the problem of poverty and now that it has gotten out of hand it 's a new crusade for the media and our democratic congress 

 nobody should have to live in such poor conditions as in sugar <unk> but when you travel to washington boston chicago or new york the same problems exist 

 the only difference is in those cities the poor are <unk> in <unk> apartments each consisting of one room with <unk> pipes called plumbing <unk> and <unk> everywhere and <unk> elevators and with the building <unk> by gangs and drug dealers

 mobil corp. is in the midst of cutting back its exploration and production group which finds and develops oil and gas reserves in the u.s. by as much as N N as part of a new restructuring of that sector of its business 

 management advised employees friday that it was going to reduce employment in production operations of the group by N N or N people 

 the exploration side of the unit has recently <unk> a similar overhaul during which it also lost as many as N employees a company spokesman said in response to questions 

 mobil exploration & producing u.s. inc. the group involved currently has a work force of somewhat less than N 

 a few years ago mobil restructured the entire company during an industrywide <unk> 

 but since then u.s. oil production has declined and mobil wants to focus its <unk> efforts overseas 

 mobil <unk> to the <unk> cuts last week when it took a $ N million charge as part of its third-quarter earnings and attributed it to a restructuring 

 mobil officials said that it is unlikely any additional charges related to this move will be taken in future quarters 

 on wednesday mobil will begin offering separation packages and voluntary retirement in its u.s. production operation 

 mobil officials said they have been studying ways of streamlining these operations since early this year 

 during the coming months <unk> of management will be <unk> away and regional offices will become more <unk> 

 for greater efficiency employees at those locations will be <unk> into teams responsible for managing the properties under their jurisdiction mobil said 

 the main feature of the new organization is that each local manager will have both the authority and accountability for profitable and technically sound operations said charles e. <unk> president of the mobil unit 

 field offices at new orleans houston denver midland <unk> <unk> calif. oklahoma city and liberal kan. will be maintained 

 but the staffs at some of those locations will be slashed while at others the work force will be increased 

 for instance employment in denver will be reduced to N from N 

 but on the west coast where profitable oil production is more likely than in the <unk> region the <unk> calif. office staff of N will grow by N to N 

 the reorganization will focus on the value and potential of assets mr. <unk> said 

 wanted an investment that 's as simple and secure as a certificate of deposit but offers a return worth getting excited about 

 with $ N billion of cds maturing this month a lot of people have been <unk> the financial landscape for just such an investment 

 in april when many of them bought their cds six-month certificates were yielding more than N N investors willing to look could find double-digit yields at some banks and thrifts 

 now the nationwide average yield on a six-month cd is just under N N and N N is about the best around 

 but investors looking for alternatives are n't finding it easy 

 yields on most fixed-income securities are lower than several months ago 

 and the stock market 's recent gyrations are a painful reminder of the dangers there 

 if you 're looking for a significantly higher yield with the same level of risk as a cd you 're not going to find it says washington financial planner dennis m. <unk> 

 there are however some alternatives that <unk> investors should consider investment advisers say 

 short-term municipal bonds bond funds and <unk> annuities are some of the choices they mention and not just as a way to get a higher return 

 in particular advisers say investors may want to look at securities that reduce the risk that cd holders are <unk> right now of having to reinvest the proceeds of maturing short-term certificates at lower rates 

 a mix of cds and other holdings may make the most sense 

 people should remember their money is n't all or nothing they do n't need to be shopping for the one <unk> investment and putting all their money in it says <unk> md. adviser karen schaeffer 

 here 's a look at some of the alternatives 

 short-term municipals 

 investors with a heavy tax load should take out their <unk> 

 yields on municipal bonds can be higher than after-tax yields on cds for maturities of perhaps one to five years 

 that 's because <unk> interest is exempt from federal income tax and from state and local taxes too for <unk> investors 

 for an investor paying tax at a N N rate a seemingly <unk> N N yield on a one-year <unk> is equivalent to a taxable N N 

 rates approach N N on five-year municipals 

 some of the more cautious cd holders might like <unk> municipals 

 these securities get top credit ratings because the issuers have put aside u.s. bonds that will be sold to pay off holders when the municipals are retired 

 it 's a <unk> you do n't have to worry about diversification you do n't have to worry about quality says steven j. <unk> executive vice president of the new york bond firm of <unk> <unk> & <unk> inc 

 consider a <unk> bond portfolio with issues maturing in say N N and N advises malcolm a. <unk> a <unk> r.i. financial planner 

 the idea is to have money rolling over each year at prevailing interest rates 

 bond funds 

 bond mutual funds offer diversification and are easy to buy and sell 

 that makes them a reasonable option for investors who will accept some risk of price <unk> in order to make a bet that interest rates will decline over the next year or so 

 buyers can look forward to double-digit annual returns if they are right 

 but they will have disappointing returns or even losses if interest rates rise instead 

 bond resale prices and thus fund share prices move in the opposite direction from rates 

 the price movements get bigger as the maturity of the securities <unk> 

 consider for instance two bond funds from vanguard group of investment cos. that were both yielding N N on a recent day 

 the short term bond fund with an average maturity of N N years would deliver a total return for one year of about N N if rates drop one percentage point and a one-year return of about N N if rates rise by the same amount 

 but in the same circumstances the returns would be a more extreme N N and N N for the vanguard bond market fund with its N 1\/2-year average maturity 

 you get <unk> returns from bonds if you guess right on rates says james e. wilson a columbia s.c. planner 

 if interest rates do n't change bond fund investors ' returns will be about equal to the funds ' current yields 

 deferred annuities 

 these insurance company contracts feature some of the same tax benefits and restrictions as <unk> individual retirement accounts investment gains are compounded without tax consequences until money is withdrawn but a N N penalty tax is imposed on withdrawals made before age N N 

 aimed specifically at cd holders are so-called <unk> annuities or certificates of annuity 

 an interest rate is guaranteed for between one and seven years after which holders get N days to choose another guarantee period or to switch to another insurer 's contract without the surrender charges that are common to annuities 

 some current rates exceed those on cds 

 for instance a <unk> annuity from north american co. for life & health insurance chicago offers N N interest for one year or a N N rate for two years 

 annuities are rarely a good idea at age N because of the withdrawal restrictions 

 but at age N they may be a great deal says mr. wilson the columbia s.c. planner 

 money market funds 

 that 's right money market mutual funds 

 the conventional wisdom is to go into money funds when rates are rising and shift out at times such as the present when rates seem headed down 

 with average maturities of a month or so money funds offer fixed share prices and floating returns that track market interest rates with a slight lag 

 still today 's <unk> money funds may beat cds over the next year even if rates fall says guy <unk> an editor of the bond market <unk> newsletter in atlanta 

 that 's because <unk> funds currently offer yields almost N N percentage points above the average cd yield

 try combining a money fund and an <unk> bond fund as a <unk> bet on falling rates suggests back bay <unk> inc. a mutual fund unit of new england insurance co 

 if rates unexpectedly rise the increasing return on the money fund will partly offset the lower-than-expected return from the bond fund 

 federal drug regulators concerned over british reports that diabetics have died after shifting from animal to <unk> insulin say they are considering a study to see if similar deaths have occurred here 

 the united kingdom reports came from dr. patrick toseland head of clinical chemistry at guy 's hospital in london 

 in a telephone interview friday dr. toseland said the number of sudden <unk> deaths of diabetics he had seen this year was N compared with just two in N 

 at least six of the deaths occurred among relatively young diabetics who had switched from animal to human insulin within the past year he said 

 dr. <unk> <unk> director of <unk> and <unk> drug products for the u.s. food and drug administration said fda officials have discussed dr. toseland 's findings fairly <unk> 

 while there have been no reports of similar sudden <unk> deaths among diabetics in the u.s. dr. <unk> said the fda plans to examine dr. toseland 's evidence and is considering its own study here 

 dr. toseland a <unk> said he was preparing an article for a british <unk> medical journal raising the possibility that the deaths may have occurred after human insulin <unk> critical warning signs indicating hypoglycemia or low blood sugar which can kill diabetics 

 the usual warning signs of hypoglycemia include <unk> anxiety and <unk> 

 with proper warning diabetics can easily raise their blood sugar to safe levels by eating sugar or <unk> food 

 the <unk> data certainly shows that some of the people were not aware of the rapid <unk> of hypoglycemia dr. toseland said 

 at the u.s. national institutes of health dr. robert e. <unk> chief of the <unk> program branch said no evidence of unexpected deaths from hypoglycemia had shown up in a study of N diabetics that has been under way at nih for five years 

 however he said officials conducting the study had n't been looking for signs of problems related to hypoglycemia <unk> 

 we are now monitoring for it much more closely he said 

 we do know there are slight differences in the way human and animal <unk> drive down blood sugar dr. <unk> said 

 the <unk> drug starts the blood sugar dropping sooner and drives it down faster he said 

 but we do n't believe there is enough of a difference to be <unk> significant dr. <unk> said 

 reports of dr. toseland 's findings in the british press have triggered widespread concern among diabetics there 

 both the british <unk> association and the committee on safety in <unk> britain 's equivalent of the u.s. fda recently issued statements noting the lack of hard scientific evidence to support dr. toseland 's findings 

 on friday the american <unk> association issued a similar statement urging the six million u.s. diabetics not to <unk> to the british report 

 a loss of the warning symptoms of hypoglycemia is a complex problem that is very unlikely to be due simply to the type of insulin used the american association said 

 the fda already requires drug manufacturers to include warnings with insulin products that symptoms of hypoglycemia are less <unk> with human insulin than with <unk> products 

 eli lilly & co. the <unk> drug manufacturer dominates the u.s. human insulin market with its product known as <unk> 

 lilly is building plants to make the insulin in indianapolis and <unk> france 

 in its latest annual report lilly said <unk> sales have shown excellent growth 

 lilly officials said they had seen reports of <unk> <unk> among some patients making the shift from animal to human insulin but did n't know if the problem had caused any deaths 

 dr. <unk> thompson a lilly group vice president said the company 's clinical trials of both its animal and <unk> <unk> indicated no difference in the level of hypoglycemia between users of either product 

 dr. toseland said most of the british diabetics who died had been taking a <unk> insulin made by <unk> a <unk> manufacturer 

 none of the diabetics were using lilly 's insulin 

 <unk> corp. said it will reduce its <unk> work force by about N N effective tomorrow in an effort to stem continuing losses 

 the company which makes data base systems and software said it expects to report a loss for the third quarter ended sept. N 

 defense intellectuals have complained for years that the pentagon can not determine priorities because it has no strategy 

 last april the new defense secretary richard cheney acknowledged that given an ideal world we 'd have a nice neat orderly process 

 we 'd do the strategy and then we 'd come around and do the budget 

 this city does n't work that way 

 with a five-year defense plan costing more than $ N trillion it 's about time we put together a defense strategy that works in washington 

 this wo n't happen until strategists come down from their ivory tower and learn to work in the real world of limited budgets and uncertain futures 

 as it is we identify national goals and the threats to these goals we shape a strategy to counter these threats we determine the forces needed to execute the strategy before finally <unk> the budgets needed to build and maintain the forces 

 these procedures consume millions of <unk> of labor and produce tons of paper and each year their end product the five year defense plan promptly <unk> away 

 the <unk> on the left shows how this happens see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 

 compare the past eight five-year plans with actual appropriations 

 the pentagon 's strategists produce budgets that simply can not be executed because they assume a defense strategy depends only on goals and threats 

 strategy however is about possibilities not hopes and dreams 

 by ignoring costs u.s. strategists <unk> their responsibility for hard decisions 

 that puts the real strategic decisions in the hands of others <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 

 these people have different <unk> 

 and as a result as the recent vote by the house to undo mr. cheney 's program <unk> suggests the <unk> of jobs is becoming the real goal of defense strategy 

 how can we turn this situation around 

 reform starts in the pentagon 

 strategists should consider the impact of budget uncertainties at the beginning of the planning process 

 they ought to examine how a range of optimistic to pessimistic budget scenarios would change the defense program 

 they would then develop priorities by identifying the least painful program cuts as they moved from higher to lower budgets 

 they would also identify the best way to add programs should the budget come in at higher levels 

 this kind of <unk> analysis is common in war planning and business planning 

 there is no reason that it can not be done for defense planning 

 two steps are necessary to translate this idea into action 

 step N <unk> up our books 

 our five-year plan contains three accounting devices negative money an above <unk> management reserve and optimistic inflation estimates which <unk> the spending the pentagon has committed itself to by almost $ N billion 

 negative money was invented in N to make the N five year defense plan conform to the numbers in president reagan 's final budget <unk> to congress 

 that plan exceeded the numbers contained in his budget message by $ N billion 

 to make the books balance as is required by law somebody invented a new budget line item that simply <unk> $ N billion 

 it is known in the pentagon as the negative wedge 

 the pentagon argues that the negative wedge is the net effect of $ N billion in the <unk> unidentified procurement reductions that it intends to find in future years and $ N billion in an above <unk> management reserve that accounts for <unk> programs that will <unk> in the future 

 the N plan also assumes inflation will decline to N N by N 

 most <unk> including those in the congressional budget office assume inflation will be in excess of N N in each of those five years 

 at that rate the defense plan is <unk> by $ N billion 

 by adding the negative wedge and <unk> the remaining program using a more probable inflation estimate we arrive at a baseline program costing $ N trillion between N and N 

 step N <unk> how four <unk> lower budget scenarios would change the baseline and how these changes would affect our national security 

 the <unk> on the right which assumes a N N rate of inflation places these scenarios in the context of recent appropriations see accompanying illustration wsj oct. N N 

 note how the baseline program assumes a sharp increase in future appropriations 

 step N will answer the question what happens if these increases do not <unk> 

 scenario N known as the constant dollar freeze <unk> the pentagon for inflation only it <unk> upward at N N per year 

 this scenario has been the rough position of the u.s. senate since N and it reduces the baseline by $ N billion between N and N 

 scenario N the current dollar freeze has been the <unk> position of the house of representatives for about four years 

 it <unk> the budget at its current level and forces the pentagon to eat the effects of inflation until N 

 this reduces the baseline by $ N billion 

 scenario N <unk> the recent <unk> between the house and the senate it <unk> the difference between scenarios N and N by increasing the budget at N N per year 

 it reduces the baseline by $ N billion 

 finally scenario N reduces the budget by N N per year for the next five years a total reduction of $ N billion 

 this can be thought of as a pessimistic prediction perhaps driven by the <unk> effects of the gramm-rudman deficit reduction law or possibly a <unk> of <unk> with the soviet union 

 the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff would construct the most effective defense program for each scenario <unk> strengths and <unk> weaknesses 

 they would conclude their efforts by producing a comprehensive net assessment for each plan including the assumptions made an analysis of its deficiencies and limitations the impact on national security and the best strategy for working around these limitations 

 this exercise would reveal the true cost of a particular program by forcing the strategists to make hard decisions 

 if for example they choose to keep the b-2 <unk> bomber they would have to sacrifice more and more other programs such as carrier <unk> or army divisions as they moved toward lower budget levels 

 these <unk> would <unk> priorities by <unk> when the cost of the b-2 became <unk> 

 some may be <unk> to argue that the idea of a strategic review merely <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> concept of the carter administration 

 but <unk> did not involve the strategic planners in the joint chiefs of staff and therefore <unk> into a <unk> drill driven by budget politics 

 anyway <unk> 's procedures were so <unk> that everyone involved was crushed under a burden of <unk> 

 a strategic review is fundamentally different 

 it would be run by the joint chiefs under simple <unk> produce the best possible force for each budget scenario and provide the secretary of defense with a comprehensive net assessment of how that force could be used to achieve u.s. goals 

 it might be feared that even thinking about lower budgets will hurt national security because the door will be opened to <unk> budget cutting by an irresponsible congress 

 this argument plays well in the atmosphere of <unk> and <unk> <unk> the pentagon and congress and unfortunately there is some truth to it 

 but in the end it must be rejected for logical as well as moral reasons 

 to say that the pentagon should act <unk> because acting <unk> will <unk> congress into acting <unk> leads to the conclusion that the pentagon should deliberately <unk> its needs in the national interest in other words that it is justified in committing a crime lying to congress because it is morally superior 

 strategy is not a game between the pentagon and congress it is the art of the possible in a world where constraints force us to choose between <unk> or <unk> alternatives 

 if we want meaningful priorities we must understand the <unk> they <unk> before we make commitments 

 strategy is not a separate event in an <unk> <unk> of <unk> events it is a way of thinking that <unk> threats to our interests in a manner consistent with our financial cultural and physical limitations 

 mr. <unk> is a permanent pentagon official 

 this is a <unk> version of an <unk> that will appear in the january issue of the naval institute proceedings 

 the views expressed do not reflect the official policy of the department of defense 

 although bullish dollar sentiment has <unk> many currency analysts say a massive sell-off probably wo n't occur in the near future 

 while wall street 's tough times and lower u.s. interest rates continue to undermine the dollar weakness in the pound and the yen is expected to offset those factors 

 by default the dollar probably will be able to hold up pretty well in coming days says <unk> <unk> a foreign-exchange adviser at credit suisse 

 we 're close to the bottom of the near-term ranges she contends 

 in late friday afternoon new york trading the dollar was at N marks and N yen off from late thursday 's N marks and N yen 

 the pound strengthened to $ N from $ N 

 in tokyo monday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen down from friday 's tokyo close of N yen 

 the dollar began friday on a firm note gaining against all major currencies in tokyo dealings and early european trading despite reports that the bank of japan was seen unloading dollars around N yen 

 the rise came as traders continued to dump the pound after the sudden resignation thursday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson 

 but once the pound <unk> with help from purchases by the bank of england and the federal reserve bank of new york the dollar was dragged down traders say by the stock-market slump that left the dow jones industrial average with a loss of N points 

 with the stock market <unk> and dollar buyers discouraged by signs of u.s. economic weakness and the recent decline in u.s. interest rates that has diminished the <unk> of dollar-denominated investments traders say the dollar is still in a <unk> position 

 they 'll be looking at levels to sell the dollar says james <unk> a foreign-exchange marketing representative at bank of montreal 

 while some analysts say the dollar eventually could test support at N marks and N yen mr. <unk> and others do n't see the currency <unk> sliding under support at N marks and N yen soon 

 predictions for limited dollar losses are based largely on the pound 's weak state after mr. lawson 's resignation and the yen 's inability to strengthen substantially when there are dollar <unk> 

 with the pound and the yen lagging behind other major currencies you do n't have a confirmation that a sharp dollar downturn is in the works says mike <unk> senior currency analyst at <unk> inc. in chicago 

 as far as the pound goes some traders say a slide toward support at $ N may be a favorable development for the dollar this week 

 while the pound has attempted to stabilize currency analysts say it is in critical condition 

 sterling plunged about four cents thursday and hit the week 's low of $ N when mr. lawson resigned from his <unk> post because of a policy <unk> with other cabinet members 

 he was succeeded by john major who friday expressed a desire for a firm pound and supported the relatively high british interest rates that he said are working exactly as intended in reducing inflation 

 but the market remains uneasy about mr. major 's policy strategy and the prospects for the pound currency analysts contend 

 although the bank of england 's tight monetary policy has fueled worries that britain 's slowing economy is headed for a recession it is widely believed that mr. lawson 's willingness to <unk> up the pound with interest-rate increases helped stem pound selling in recent weeks 

 if there are any signs that mr. major will be less inclined to use interest-rate boosts to rescue the pound from another plunge that currency is expected to fall sharply 

 it 's fair to say there are more risks for the pound under major than there were under lawson says malcolm roberts a director of international bond market research at salomon brothers in london 

 there 's very little upside to sterling mr. roberts says but he adds that near-term losses may be small because the selling wave that followed mr. major 's appointment apparently has run its course 

 but some other analysts have a <unk> forecast for the pound particularly because britain 's inflation is <unk> at a relatively <unk> annual rate of about N N and the nation is <unk> with a struggling government and large current account and trade deficits 

 the pound likely will fall in coming days and may trade as low as N marks within the next year says nigel <unk> an international economist at james capel & co. in london 

 the pound was at N marks late friday off sharply from N in new york trading a week earlier 

 if the pound falls closer to N marks the bank of england may raise britain 's base lending rate by one percentage point to N N says mr. <unk> 

 but such an increase he says could be viewed by the market as too little too late 

 the bank of england indicated its desire to leave its monetary policy unchanged friday by declining to raise the official N N <unk> rate that it charges discount houses analysts say 

 pound concerns aside the lack of strong buying interest in the yen is another <unk> for the dollar many traders say 

 the dollar has a natural base of support around N yen because the japanese currency has n't been purchased heavily in recent weeks says ms. <unk> of credit suisse 

 the yen 's softness she says apparently stems from japanese investors ' interest in buying dollars against the yen to purchase u.s. bond issues and persistent worries about this year 's upheaval in the japanese government

 we are deeply <unk> that a recent editorial stated that the americans with disabilities act of N was <unk> primarily by democratic senators kennedy and <unk> with a <unk> based on the <unk> that most americans are hostile to the disabled

 efforts by the hong kong futures exchange to introduce a new interest-rate futures contract continue to hit <unk> despite the support the proposed instrument enjoys in the colony 's financial community 

 hong kong financial institutions have been waiting for interest-rate futures for a long time 

 the contract was first proposed more than two years ago but shortly afterward the colony 's markets were hit hard by the october N global stock crash 

 the subsequent drive to reform hong kong 's markets also has <unk> the interest-rate futures contract 

 the securities and futures commission a government <unk> set up after the N crash to try to restore confidence and order to hong kong 's markets had been expected to give the contract conditional approval last week 

 but regulators this week said <unk> officials still have a way to go before they answer all the remaining detailed questions about the contract 

 the exchange had forecast that the contract would begin trading by december 

 but securities regulators now say privately that it is n't likely to start until the first quarter of next year 

 analysts and financial officials in the british colony consider the new contract essential to the revival of the hong kong futures exchange which has never fully recovered from the october N crash 

 many believe that without a healthy futures exchange hong kong 's aspirations to be recognized as an international financial center will suffer 

 in addition local banks say the new contract is important in helping them offset their hong <unk> exposure 

 the contract will be based on the three-month hong kong interbank offered rate or <unk> 

 it is almost a carbon copy of the chicago mercantile exchange 's eurodollar contract which is based on the three-month eurodollar rate the rate paid on <unk> deposits in london banks 

 if the contract is as successful as some expect it may do much to restore confidence in futures trading in hong kong 

 the contract is definitely important to the exchange says robert <unk> executive director of the securities and futures commission 

 two years ago the futures exchange was the envy of other would-be futures centers 

 after only N months its main contract based on the hang seng index had grown to be the second-largest <unk> contract in the world 

 a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell a commodity or financial instrument at a set price on a specified date 

 in the case of stock-index and interest-rate futures the instruments are given an underlying cash value and are settled in cash 

 but in the week following the N stock crash the exchange <unk> on collapse and the stock and futures markets in hong kong were closed for four days 

 only a <unk> bailout kept the crisis from <unk> the exchange 

 trading in hang seng index futures remains <unk> by the experience 

 volume for the entire month of september totaled only N contracts compared with a daily average of N in the month before the N crash 

 despite the thin trading and after two painful years of restructuring the futures market has shown itself to be <unk> in two recent tests 

 while asian markets struggled to cope with the uncertainty caused by the oct. N plunge in new york stock prices futures trading in hong kong was relatively heavy and went smoothly 

 that was also the case in the days following the june N massacre in beijing which caused a sharp drop in hong kong stock prices 

 there was no problem at all says douglas ford chief executive officer of the futures exchange 

 most important to the contract 's success is the commitment of hong kong 's big financial institutions especially the two leaders <unk> & shanghai banking corp. and the local subsidiary of britain 's standard chartered bank plc 

 the two big banks were instrumental in designing the new contract 

 if those two banks are there then the balance of the banking institutions will be there says mr. <unk> the securities and futures commission official 

 colony banks have a major stake in how interest rates move because of their enormous hong <unk> exposure 

 even though the currency is pegged to the u.s. dollar with a fixed exchange rate of hk$ N to the american currency the u.s. and hong kong economies do n't always move in lock step making it difficult to predict where interest rates in the colony will go 

 in early N when the three-month eurodollar rate was between N N and N N the three-month <unk> rate was as low as N N 

 just a few months ago the three-month eurodollar rate was around N N while three-month <unk> hit highs above N N 

 the <unk> contract <unk> quite a bit of the problem of interest-rate risk in the interbank market says eric <unk> a director of james capel far east ltd. the hong kong arm of the british brokerage firm 

 despite the initial support expected trading in the contract is likely to start slowly 

 the <unk> from the N crash have n't yet <unk> and not all claims against the exchange <unk> by those who bet the hang seng index would fall have been settled 

 companies and financial institutions familiar with hong kong remain wary of trading in its futures market 

 and mr. <unk> <unk> that there may be limits on how much the contract can grow because the hong kong dollar is n't a widely traded currency 

 he says the contract will be considered a success if it starts trading N to N lots a day 

 exchange officials also point out that <unk> futures were designed for institutions and corporations not for the type of small individual investors who were very active in hang seng index futures and defaulted in the N crash 

 mr. <unk> says the low margin required for trading futures attracted a lot of small investors before the N crash who did n't realize that their risk was virtually <unk> 

 you 're not going to get your taxi drivers and <unk> and all that says <unk> nicholas a director for securities company elders bullion & futures ltd 

 that should help to <unk> confidence mr. <unk> says 

 but many bankers remain nervous especially as the start-up of the contract continues to be delayed

 when the going gets tough it 's tough to trade stocks in continental europe 

 that 's the troubling conclusion reached by many international investors and money managers angry at the <unk> on continental stock exchanges during last week 's global market turbulence 

 they say the recent market volatility has underscored the <unk> of the way many european exchanges trade stocks 

 the weaknesses of continental exchanges are driving some fund managers to switch business to stocks traded on london 's stock exchange which quotes firm trading prices for about N blue-chip issues from N major countries 

 i 'm not saying london covered itself in glory but the events of the past week have certainly exposed europe 's weaknesses says stewart <unk> a director of scottish amicable investment managers in <unk> scotland which manages about # N billion $ N billion in institutional money 

 he says the problems on european exchanges included <unk> <unk> delayed execution of buy and sell orders and trading <unk> 

 the events strengthen london 's hand in becoming the center for trading european stocks mr. <unk> says 

 unable to unload a large block of a french blue-chip company 's shares in paris for two days last week a frustrated scottish amicable fund manager finally <unk> down her phone in <unk> and called james capel & co. a london brokerage firm 

 the firm did the trade in seconds on the london stock exchange 's <unk> <unk> system 

 on so-called manic monday oct. N stock prices plunged across europe and trading problems erupted 

 london had some problems too 

 the london exchange 's electronic <unk> system provided only <unk> or <unk> prices for about N minutes on manic monday 

 some dealers say other traders were n't picking up their phones 

 but london 's problems were nothing compared with the continent 's 

 in brussels which recently spent millions of dollars on a <unk> trading system <unk> traders watched <unk> as a software failure before opening on manic monday prevented trading for two days 

 for N hours no one had any idea precisely how much his securities were worth 

 by wednesday frustrated belgian brokers reopened the market by using the <unk> method of <unk> stocks with <unk> on a <unk> 

 the belgian computer system finally was repaired and <unk> on tuesday of this week with the aid of toronto stock exchange officials who developed the system 

 in frankfurt which only has a <unk> daily <unk> session even in the best of times stocks did n't open for the first N minutes because of order imbalances that brokers blame on a wave of sell orders from small investors 

 as banks processed <unk> <unk> of sell orders the crush led to manic monday 's worst decline german stocks ended down N N 

 exchange officials extended trading hours N minutes on monday and N minutes on tuesday to clear up order backlogs 

 in france more than half the top N blue-chip stocks including such giants as bsn and <unk> <unk> did n't open until wall street rallied late in the european trading day traders say 

 the rally transformed some big sell orders into big buy orders solving an <unk> problem 

 but by that time many big institutions had switched business to london 

 belgium was closed for two days france closed for a couple of hours germany was stuck 

 it was a nightmare says susan noble an investment manager at robert fleming holdings ltd. 's international investment management unit in london 

 it 's very worrying that these markets ca n't cope 

 on manic monday the volume of german shares traded in london more than tripled to N million and the volume of french shares rose N N 

 by comparison german domestic stock volume in frankfurt only doubled that day 

 the switch to the london market during such <unk> times is significant 

 for one thing the size of the affected market is enormous the european stock markets account for some N N of global stock market capitalization with an estimated value of $ N trillion according to morgan stanley capital international 

 the continental markets alone contribute about N N of estimated world market capitalization of $ N trillion 

 though the widely traded shares that are quoted in london account for only a small portion of those totals they still are the most closely watched stocks and are often viewed as a barometer for the local markets generally 

 the switch to london <unk> the fact that despite the economic restructuring associated with european community efforts to develop a single market by N european stock trading remains a highly <unk> and very <unk> activity 

 against this backdrop one thing that does n't seem likely to result from N is a single european stock market 

 rather there increasingly is a group of international brokerage and trading firms that operate in most european financial centers including european giants such as barclays bank plc and deutsche bank as well as merrill lynch & co. and shearson lehman hutton inc. of the u.s. and japan 's nomura securities co 

 these firms which often have acquired a local brokerage firm are calling the shots when it comes to deciding in which market to <unk> a trade 

 and senior officials of two u.s. securities houses say they switched trades in european stocks to the london market last week when they could n't <unk> positions on the continent 

 meantime brokers on the continent are worried too mostly by the potential loss of business 

 i would be much <unk> if this volume in german stocks were in frankfurt rather than london says <unk> <unk> head of international equity sales at dresdner bank in frankfurt 

 he acknowledges that spreads were too wide and volumes too light in the extreme conditions on manic monday 

 already the germans appear to be acting at a special meeting on the day of the decline directors of the frankfurt stock exchange voted to extend their trading hours although they have n't decided when or by how much 

 a frankfurt exchange official acknowledging the brokers ' <unk> says the market still feels it <unk> ok during this crash 

 the dutch who had some trading problems because of insufficient computer capacity say new equipment to solve the problems ought to be installed within a month 

 says a spokeswoman for the brussels <unk> nobody around here will tell you they are happy the system did n't work 

 but it 's just one of those things that happened 

 investors can be assured now that this kind of problem can never occur again 

 but for others the <unk> echo the promises made after the N stock crash when similar problems led many markets to develop the new systems that performed so badly last week 

 they all said they invested huge amounts of money 

 but they either did n't buy the right machines or they wasted it says fleming 's ms. noble 

 canadian steel production totaled N metric tons in the week ended oct. N a N N increase from N tons the previous week but a N N decline from N tons a year earlier statistics canada said

 european community employers fear that the ec commission 's plans for a charter of fundamental social rights is a danger to industrial competitiveness 

 we do n't want brussels deciding conditions for workers unless they are necessary and useful said <unk> <unk> secretary general of the employers ' confederation <unk> 

 <unk> an <unk> for the union of industrial and employers ' <unk> of europe fears that the charter will force ec countries to adopt a single pattern in labor relations 

 workers and management mr. <unk> said would lose the flexibility and diversity that has so far allowed them to <unk> to local conditions and <unk> 

 the british government also strongly opposes the charter in its current form 

 it argues as does <unk> that labor relations are best left to be regulated at the national level 

 france will propose a slightly <unk> version of the charter to be discussed by ec <unk> ministers on monday officials said 

 but the cosmetic changes are n't expected to win over britain 

 we still have serious differences with the text a british official said because it provides for a regulation of the labor market 

 mr. <unk> said the charter would put poorer ec countries such as spain greece and portugal at a disadvantage 

 it would force these countries to introduce minimum standards for pay and working hours and provide for collective bargaining and worker participation in major corporate decisions 

 this he warned would prevent these countries from <unk> the difference with their richer ec <unk> 

 indeed lower wages in greece they are a third of the ec average are n't enough to offset higher transport costs and lower productivity in the southern countries 

 increasing labor costs mr. <unk> argued would only put the countries at a further disadvantage in competing in the <unk> ec market planned for after N 

 but the <unk> official said that producing a charter acceptable to both britain and european industry is n't an <unk> goal 

 the charter would just have to be restricted to a list of workers ' fundamental rights without seeking to impose any <unk> 

 a key provision in the current version of the charter would give the commission a mandate to produce an action program detailing on what points ec member states would be required to comply with the goals set out in the charter 

 this provision lies at the heart of the british and <unk> fears of social engineering by the commission 

 one possible political solution an ec official said would be for the commission to present the action program in late november before the adoption of the charter at a summit of ec governments on dec. N and N 

 this would leave britain free to adopt the charter after having <unk> the action program 

 the charter was approved by the ec commission on sept. N 

 france 's socialist government which currently holds the council 's <unk> presidency is committed to having the charter adopted by all N ec states before the end of N the <unk> of the french revolution and its universal declaration of human rights

 we 've been putting in long hours mr. ramirez says <unk> weeks and <unk> days for the last two months 

 a year ago when almost nothing was happening amid these <unk> dunes you 'd spend two days working and two days in the yard he recalls 

 after a three-year nightmare of uncertain oil prices <unk> budget cuts and sweeping layoffs fear is finally leaving the oil patch 

 independent <unk> are <unk> sinking <unk> into the earth 's <unk> again 

 some in big oil are easing the grip on their <unk> 

 investment capital is creeping back and oil properties are <unk> more 

 <unk> prices are even <unk> up 

 what happened 

 in <unk> terms stability has quietly settled into international oil markets 

 mideast politics have <unk> down and the <unk> within the organization of petroleum exporting countries seems under control for now 

 the fundamentals of supply and demand once again are setting oil prices says victor <unk> an arthur <unk> & co. oil expert 

 after years of wild swings oil prices over the last N months have settled at around $ N to $ N a barrel 

 that is n't the $ N that <unk> producers a decade ago or the $ N that pleased users a year ago 

 but it is high enough to <unk> the search for future supplies low enough to promote consumption and most important steady enough for both producers and users to believe in 

 not that oil suddenly is a sure thing again 

 the current <unk> is fragile and depends on steady strong demand and continued relative harmony within opec producer of more than N N of the <unk> world 's crude 

 a recession or new opec <unk> could put oil markets right back in the soup 

 also the new <unk> are <unk> and some question their extent 

 drilling activity is still far below eight years ago there 's no hiring surge and some companies continue to shrink 

 with all this even the most wary oil men agree something has changed 

 it does n't appear to be getting worse 

 that in itself has got to cause people to feel a little more optimistic says glenn cox the president of phillips petroleum co 

 though modest the change reaches beyond the oil patch too 

 the same roller-coaster prices that halted u.s. oil exploration and drove many veteran oil men and companies out of the business also played havoc with the nation 's inflation rate the trade deficit and oil users ' corporate and personal budgets 

 now at least some <unk> has returned for everyone from economists to <unk> 

 corporate planners can plan again 

 management does n't want surprises notes jack <unk> who as <unk> director at american airlines buys some N billion gallons of jet fuel a year 

 prices had been so unstable that two years ago mr. <unk> gave up on long-term forecasts 

 and consumers should be comfortable adds w. <unk> moore u.s. deputy secretary of energy 

 i do n't see anything on the horizon that could lead to a <unk> rise in the price 

 the catalyst for all this has been opec 

 about a year ago it ended an <unk> <unk> internal production war that had put prices on a roller <unk> and pitched oil towns from houston to <unk> into recession 

 saudi arabia opec 's <unk> abandoned a policy of flooding the market to punish <unk> 

 about the same time the <unk> war which was <unk> oil markets ended 

 in addition global petroleum demand has been climbing 

 it is projected to keep growing by a million barrels a day or up to N N annually for years to come 

 for opec that 's ideal 

 the resulting firm prices and stability will allow both producers and consumers to plan <unk> says saudi <unk> oil minister <unk> <unk> 

 opec <unk> <unk> explains consumers offer security of markets while opec provides security of supply 

 this is an <unk> time to find mutual ways to prevent price shocks from happening again he says 

 to promote this balance opec now is finally <unk> a <unk> internal problem 

 at its november meeting it will try to revise its quotas to satisfy persian gulf members that can produce far more oil than their <unk> 

 being held well below capacity greatly <unk> them and has led to widespread cheating 

 opec has repeatedly raised its <unk> production ceiling to <unk> some of that unauthorized output 

 oil ministers now hope to solve the issue for good through an iranian proposal that gives a larger share of output to countries with surplus capacity and reduces the shares of those that ca n't produce more anyway 

 but if they walk out without any effort to resolve their problem production could increase to N million or N million barrels a day making for a very troublesome first quarter warns <unk> <unk> a consultant and former <unk> opec delegate 

 that would send prices <unk> from what some <unk> u.s. oil executives still regard as too low a level 

 patrick <unk> early president of amoco corp. 's <unk> unit says that despite recent stability he plans continued tightening of costs and exploration spending 

 the view of some others in big oil he maintains is very much similar to amoco 's outlook 

 just this week mobil corp. disclosed new cutbacks in its domestic exploration and production operations 

 out here on the <unk> plains of new mexico however the mood is more upbeat trucks <unk> along the dusty roads and <unk> men in hard hats sweat and <unk> through the afternoon sun 

 santa fe energy co. a unit of santa fe southern pacific co. bought from amoco the rights that allowed it to drill the <unk> 

 a mile and a half away looms the <unk> rig of the <unk> due to be pumping by december 

 talk is that everybody is going to drill more wells says <unk> <unk> <unk> 

 santa fe aims to drill about N wells in this area in N and double that next year 

 it is more aggressive than most but it is n't the only company with a new attitude as it found when it went looking for a partner for the <unk> 

 we went to six companies over two days pitching the prospect says tim parker a santa fe exploration manager 

 five were interested 

 mitchell energy & development corp. became the partner <unk> up more than half of the $ N in drilling and start-up costs 

 mitchell will get a <unk> in the oil 

 a kind of <unk> mentality had been <unk> activity says don <unk> mitchell 's oil exploration chief 

 now everybody is a lot more optimistic 

 one attraction for oil operators here and in other fields is the <unk> cost of drilling and equipment reflecting service companies ' <unk> for work 

 <unk> oil co. a small texas independent is currently drilling two wells itself and putting money into three others 

 one of its wells in southwestern oklahoma is a rank <unk> a risky well where oil previously has n't been found 

 at this price $ N plus or minus and with costs being significantly less than they were several years ago the economics are pretty good says george <unk> head of the company 

 if you know you 've got stability in price you can do things you would n't do with the volatility of the past few years 

 the activity is enough to move some <unk> prices back up a little 

 some <unk> prices have risen N N in the past month 

 in the gulf of mexico a boat to deliver supplies to offshore <unk> now costs around $ N a day up nearly N N since june 

 some service <unk> recently were auctioned for about $ N million each up from less than $ N million two years ago 

 at the bottom of the slump <unk> inc. was discounting N N on an electronic evaluation of a well now it discounts about N N <unk> say 

 still there is money to be made 

 most oil companies when they set exploration and production budgets for this year forecast revenue of $ N for each barrel of crude produced 

 prices have averaged more than $ N a barrel higher than that not a <unk> but at least a <unk> bonus for them 

 so according to a dun & bradstreet corp. survey companies that had been refusing to spend even their very conservative budgets may loosen up before year end 

 it says N N of those surveyed report that N exploration spending will exceed N 's 

 funds for drilling may inch up more next year if oil prices stay stable 

 texaco thinking in terms of $ <unk> oil for N may raise spending especially for <unk> prospects an official says 

 outside investors scarce since <unk> are <unk> back 

 although it 's still difficult to raise money for a pure <unk> program says william thomas a texas commerce bank official in houston institutions are starting to see there are cycles to these things and this one is beginning to turn 

 wall street generally likes the industry again 

 the appetite for <unk> stocks has been especially strong although some got hit yesterday when shearson lehman hutton cut its short-term investment ratings on them 

 contractors such as parker drilling co. are raising cash again through stock offerings and for the first time in years two <unk> companies recently went public 

 they are grace energy corp. of dallas and marine drilling co. of houston 

 most oil companies are still reluctant to add to the office and professional staffs they slashed so deeply 

 but a few new spots are opening 

 arthur <unk> the accounting firm has increased its energy staff N N in a year 

 out in the oil fields if activity picks up much more shortages could appear because so many <unk> <unk> and others left after the crash 

 already it 's hard to get people 

 they 're so busy says one santa fe drilling <unk> here 

 for most field workers it 's about time 

 mr. ramirez who arrived late at the <unk> with his crew because he had started early in the morning setting up tanks at another site just got the first raise he can remember in eight years to $ N an hour from $ N 

 norman young a <unk> at the <unk> well has worked all but about nine days of this year 

 last year i was off a straight month then one time for two to three weeks and another two to three weeks he says

 a native of the area he is back now after riding the <unk> boom to the top then surviving the <unk> running an oklahoma city convenience store 

 first year i came back there was n't any work he says 

 i think it 's on the way back now 

 but it wo n't be a boom again 

 no major <unk> no major setbacks he predicts 

 business has been good enough that he just took a <unk> weekend trip to the mountain area of <unk> something i have n't done in years 

 the figures confirm that there certainly is n't any drilling boom 

 only N wells including N dry <unk> were <unk> for oil and natural gas in the u.s. in the first nine months of the year down N N from the like N period 

 but that was off less than at midyear when <unk> lagged by N N 

 and the number of <unk> active in the u.s. is <unk> up 

 according to baker hughes inc. N <unk> <unk> were at work in the u.s. last week up from the year-ago count of N

 mr. dorfman states that an investor who invested $ N a year ago in the first four stocks selected by your pros and then sold those one month later purchasing the four new pro picks and repeated this process for the year would have accumulated $ N excluding account dividends taxes and commissions 

 in contrast an investor holding the dow jones portfolio over the year would have accumulated only $ N 

 accepted theories of asset pricing offer a perfectly legitimate explanation 

 accepted theories state that investors require higher returns on riskier investments 

 thus rather than seeing the excess returns to the <unk> portfolio as being <unk> i see those returns as simply <unk> for taking on added risk 

 i believe the risk for each individual stock selected by your pros is very large 

 if you asked me to select a stock with the highest expected return i would select a stock with the greatest amount of <unk> risk as i am sure your pros do 

 your hypothetical investor is simply being <unk> for taking on this added risk 

 moreover your hypothetical investor has <unk> the gains to be had in reducing risk by diversifying his portfolio 

 a <unk> portfolio is still exposed to a great deal of unnecessary risk 

 this means the returns can vary a great deal 

 mr. dorfman provides confirming evidence of this phenomenon when he reports that your staff of <unk> <unk> would have accumulated only $ N by <unk> <unk> four new stocks to be held in a portfolio each month 

 scott e. <unk> texas <unk> university <unk> texas your investment <unk> article misses the target 

 the fact that stock pickers have <unk> a <unk> selected portfolio in eight of N months has no bearing on the <unk> theory 

 what matters is that the stocks recommended by your pros tend to be substantially riskier than a diversified portfolio 

 for example your pickers ' recommendations for the coming month are on average N N riskier than holding the market portfolio according to value line 's beta estimates 

 james morgan 's pick for october <unk> is a substantial N N riskier than the market portfolio his <unk> <unk> <unk> pick is N N riskier

 california <unk> make travel agents jittery 

 being a travel agent used to be pretty glamorous 

 now it 's getting downright dangerous 

 in recent months more than N agencies have been robbed compared with only a handful all last year according to police and <unk> groups 

 most of the cases have been in california where one agent was <unk> and another was shot and killed 

 los angeles police say the thieves seem to be part of a crime network that knows how to convert blank tickets into real ones 

 already the stolen tickets have been used for flights all over the world 

 so far the thieves have stolen N blank tickets according to airline reporting corp. a ticket processing center 

 police say the <unk> are usually pulled off by two to five men who walk into the agencies near closing or lunch time when few employees are there 

 they looked like ordinary <unk> at first says <unk> <unk> owner of travel air service in monte <unk> calif. describing five men who entered his agency last june 

 but then he says they put two loaded <unk> to his temple and demanded he open the safe 

 when he initially refused he says they <unk> him in the back and made off with $ N and N blank tickets 

 they said they wanted to show me how serious they were he says 

 as word of the crime spree has spread many agents have started changing their <unk> policies 

 at el monte travel center in el monte calif. customers now can get in only through a <unk> and lock system 

 it 's hard to deal with clients this way in a service business says ralph <unk> conner owner of the agency which was robbed of N blank tickets and $ N last month 

 but we 're just too nervous 

 the <unk> also have set off a controversy involving the airlines 

 agents say airlines which track ticket numbers of all stolen tickets should be doing more to catch the thieves by <unk> the tickets when they 're used 

 they have the most sophisticated computers in the world says mr. <unk> 

 they ought to be able to do this 

 but airlines say it would be too expensive and cause too many delays if they started using computerized <unk> to check tickets at the gate 

 texans get reasonable car rental insurance 

 consumer advocates have long claimed that car rental companies charge too much for car rental insurance 

 now a new law in texas seems to be providing the proof 

 the law the first of its kind requires car rental companies in texas to charge only reasonable rates for <unk> waiver insurance 

 specifically the law says the rates must closely reflect what the company 's actual expenses have been to replace damaged cars 

 before the law went into effect last month car rental companies were charging as much as $ N a day for the waiver in texas 

 now they 're charging as little $ N a day 

 if they 're telling the truth now then they 've been charging N N more than what is reasonable says steve <unk> an assistant state attorney general in texas 

 a spokesman for hertz corp. acknowledges the waiver is n't a source of protection for consumers but a source of revenue 

 but hertz points out that at least it 's now charging only $ N a day in texas while some competitors are charging $ N 

 the state attorney general 's office is investigating rental car agencies charging <unk> higher prices 

 flight attendants lag before jets even land 

 if your flight <unk> seems a little <unk> it may be because he or she has been working N straight hours 

 a recent study for the federal aviation administration found that major airlines sometimes make flight attendants work N hours or more straight despite union contracts at some airlines limiting duty time to N hours 

 some flight attendants on charter planes are putting in <unk> work days the study found 

 this happens because the faa does n't have any rules on duty time for flight attendants by contrast it strictly restricts duty time for pilots and air traffic controllers usually to a maximum of N consecutive hours 

 as far as the faa is concerned says <unk> <unk> air safety director at the association of flight attendants flight attendants can work an <unk> number of hours 

 experts say such long hours for attendants pose a safety risk 

 for instance tired flight attendants might not react quickly enough during an emergency evacuation 

 at the end of their day they are <unk> says john <unk> president of the aviation safety institute a <unk> group in <unk> ohio 

 they have to work such long hours and then we expect them to be heroes if there 's an evacuation 

 in response to the study the faa says it is considering changing its policy or lack of it on flight attendants 

 the agency may not have much choice a congressional bill has been introduced that would force the agency to limit flight <unk> duty time to N hours on u.s. flights and N hours on international trips

 why do you continually ignore the <unk> effects of indexing the basis of capital gains for inflation 

 why do you maintain the house-passed capital-gains plan is a temporary reduction when it is not 

 i think the reason is that you are confusing tax rates with tax payments 

 your sept. N page-one story on the house-passed capital-gains plan is a good example 

 you lead readers to believe that the house reduced the capital-gains tax for two years only 

 you virtually ignore the <unk> power of indexation which in many cases is more substantial than a lower rate 

 the monetary tax benefit of indexation for all gains in excess of inflation can be measured using the following equation tax rate times inflation rate times basis for the gain 

 depending on the size of the gain and the rate of inflation indexation can mean a lower tax payment than using the N N rate without indexation 

 but in any event and this is the important point tax payments on capital gains will be lower with indexation than under current law even though the tax rate is the same under both systems 

 as you can see the capital-gains reduction plan adopted by the house would not be temporary but permanent 

 i hope that you begin talking about the plan 's permanent and in my view most beneficial feature indexation 

 rep. robert k. <unk> r. calif washington 

 that the <unk> for the two-year reduction to N N is budgetary does not mean it is not in the public interest 

 the reduction <unk> the burden on portfolio changes and <unk> capital to seek more productive or more appropriate uses 

 but what is really significant is the indexation of capital gains after N 

 to argue that this is not likely to affect the economy in positive ways is contrary both to recent experience with capital-gains tax cuts and to common sense 

 a large part of the long-term appreciation of assets reflects inflation and the taxation of <unk> capital gains is <unk> 

 does the journal really believe that people ignore the prospect of having a substantial part of their capital confiscated when they decide whether to save or how to invest 

 under current law it is not financially rational to <unk> consumption

 the financial accounting standards board said it will soon issue a rule requiring disclosure about the financial risk of certain financial instruments 

 but the chief <unk> body for accountants backed off one part of its original proposal made earlier this year that would have required a breakdown of certain <unk> items related to <unk> sheet instruments 

 the <unk> detail was opposed by many banks and thrifts that felt the cost of supplying such data was n't worth the value of the disclosures 

 under the initial proposal for example banks would have been required to disclose that portion of <unk> for loan losses that reflects specific letters of credit for which customers had defaulted 

 the final rule wo n't require such a breakdown of the <unk> for loan losses which appears on the balance sheet 

 the fasb rule will cover such financial instruments as interest rate swaps financial guarantees <unk> interest rate contracts loan contracts loan commitments and options written on <unk> held 

 it will require companies to <unk> out in more detail collateral <unk> and <unk> of credit risk for all financial instruments 

 the rule will require companies with financial instruments that have <unk> sheet risks to disclose data about the value and terms of the instruments any accounting loss that would occur if the outside party involved in the instrument failed to perform and the company 's policy for requiring collateral or other security for the instrument

 poughkeepsie savings bank said a plan to sell its south carolina branch offices to first citizens bank of columbia s.c. fell through

 a potentially safer whooping cough vaccine made by novel genetic engineering techniques was described by a team of italian u.s. and japanese scientists 

 the team reported they managed to induce bacteria to produce a <unk> version of the <unk> produced by the bacterium that causes whooping cough 

 laboratory tests showed that <unk> versions of the <unk> are capable of <unk> an <unk> to whooping cough the researchers reported in this week 's issue of the journal science 

 the current vaccine for whooping cough or pertussis is part of the <unk> for <unk> pertussis <unk> shot given most <unk> and young children 

 the vaccine is effective in preventing a disease that still <unk> about N million children a year world-wide causing an estimated one million deaths 

 the vaccine however causes <unk> reactions that can be fatal 

 the reactions stem from the fact that the vaccine contains multiple copies of the whole <unk> pertussis bacterium which causes whooping cough 

 this bacterium produces a toxin that if used as a vaccine can induce <unk> to whooping cough 

 unfortunately the toxin is also <unk> 

 the <unk> scientific team said they had succeeded in getting bacteria to produce a <unk> version of the pertussis toxin which could be used as a safe vaccine 

 the researchers reported they have been able to <unk> the five genes that produced the toxin out of the pertussis bacterium 

 it turned out that although it took all five genes to produce the toxin only one was responsible for the toxin 's <unk> 

 ordinarily in genetic engineering each of these genes minus the one that caused the <unk> would have been transferred to another bacterium called e. <unk> which would then produce a <unk> version of the toxin 

 the researchers said they did this but the toxin did n't induce <unk> to whooping cough 

 the scientists then took the five toxin genes and triggered a <unk> in the one gene that caused <unk> 

 then using a new technique called <unk> <unk> for introducing genes into cells they transferred all five genes to bacteria closely related to the pertussis <unk> 

 these <unk> <unk> ordinarily do n't make the toxin 

 but the genes were accompanied by a piece of dna called a <unk> that turns the genes on 

 the new bacteria recipients of the genes began producing pertussis toxin which because of the <unk> <unk> gene was no longer toxic

 at a time when foreign banks are pouring vast resources and personnel into west germany 's financial center the opening of a <unk> office on a frankfurt side street should n't attract much attention 

 unless of course it happens to be run by the rothschilds 

 after an <unk> absence from the <unk> of the family banking empire the return of the rothschild group to frankfurt was greeted by the glare of television lights <unk> reporters and a mayoral reception in town hall 

 like other foreign banks establishing a presence here the family describes its move as a calculated decision to set up a financial services <unk> in europe 's largest economy ahead of the integration of european community markets after N 

 yet the rothschilds do n't deny an emotional element to the decision 

 in N mayer <unk> rothschild founded <unk> <unk> rothschild & sons and later sent his four sons to london paris vienna and <unk> to begin the bank 's expansion during the early 19th century 

 the original bank in frankfurt closed in N after the death of <unk> carl von rothschild and the family 's banking activities focused on london and paris 

 <unk> <unk> de rothschild the family 's <unk> spokesman explains that by the end of the 19th century berlin had replaced frankfurt as germany 's financial center 

 yet the chief reason for the <unk> he says was rooted in a family tradition that would n't allow a bank to bear the rothschild name without a rothschild in its management 

 at the time we had only daughters explains the <unk> <unk> so we had to close the bank 

 much of the family 's <unk> remained 

 although its <unk> residence was destroyed by <unk> during world war ii the rothschilds ' place in frankfurt 's history is still recalled by the city park and a street bearing the rothschild name 

 the family 's long absence is <unk> 

 the family was in allied countries during both world war i and the long period of economic <unk> of the 1920s 

 during the third reich the rothschilds were a target of <unk> propaganda against jewish financiers 

 the <unk> pursued the rothschilds across europe as the <unk> grabbed countries <unk> the family 's property in the process 

 american journalist william l. <unk> in his book the rise and fall of the third reich wrote of how in vienna he had <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk> men <unk> off silver <unk> paintings and other <unk> from the rothschild palace 

 in the immediate postwar years the rothschilds concentrated on rebuilding their other european operations delaying their return to frankfurt 

 for a member of the rothschild family the return to frankfurt is a very meaningful event although it might not mean as much to german banking as it means to us says <unk> david de rothschild <unk> 's younger <unk> and a partner in rothschild & cie banque in paris 

 indeed the competition is n't greatly concerned 

 it would be surprising if they did n't come to frankfurt in time for N and they bring an interesting tradition 

 but the market really is n't going to be stood on its head said a banker at one of frankfurt 's big three banks 

 the return of the rothschilds is modest 

 the new representative office with one manager and two <unk> none a member of the rothschild family will carry out no banking operations of its own 

 instead it is to seek out corporate financing business and sell investment products on behalf of the family 's mainstay banking units <unk> <unk> rothschild & sons ltd. in london rothschild & cie. in paris and rothschild bank ag in zurich 

 the constraints do n't bother the office 's <unk> manager erich <unk> 

 he left his job as general manager of shearson lehman hutton holdings inc. 's frankfurt office because he says when the rothschilds called i could n't resist 

 each rothschild bank is linked by family ties and <unk> 

 in march <unk> <unk> rothschild in london and rothschild bank in zurich showed assets of # N billion $ N billion and N billion swiss francs $ N million respectively 

 the paris bank does n't publish that figure 

 in europe the rothschilds banks are focusing on mergers and acquisitions as european industry <unk> ahead of N 

 yet the group 's limited resources makes it a niche player 

 obviously there are <unk> limitations on the assistance we can provide concedes <unk> david de rothschild but we feel we have some cards to play 

 among them he says is the family 's traditional ties to old wealth and <unk> in banking and industry throughout europe and beyond 

 the rothschilds hope to use a long history in private banking and an <unk> of exclusivity to attract private and institutional investors 

 as at the zurich bank the minimum investment for individuals will be high about a million german marks $ N three times what many other west german investment banks require 

 but we do make exceptions says a smiling <unk> <unk> de rothschild especially if they are very young and have very rich parents 

 as program trading comes under renewed attack for causing stock market gyrations a few people on wall street say it is time to consider extreme measures 

 the real answer to curbing wild swings in stock prices they say might be to curb or even abolish stock-index futures 

 a stock-index future is a contract to buy or sell the market value of a basket of stocks such as the standard & poor 's 500-stock index 

 since stock futures were created in N trading on the chicago mercantile exchange and other exchanges has <unk> to the point where trading in stock-index futures rivals that in the stocks themselves 

 the conventional view as voiced by goldman sachs & co. partner <unk> black is that stocks and <unk> such as futures and options form a single market and that <unk> make it a more liquid market 

 but increasingly people are questioning that view and the critics include some of the country 's most successful investors 

 warren buffett has been on record as opposing stock-index futures since their inception in N 

 and mario <unk> another star in the investing world says my gut says the <unk> of futures and <unk> far outweigh the benefits 

 like others mr. <unk> says that if futures cause investors to lose confidence in stocks they will move away from stocks as many have already done 

 and those who remain he says will demand a higher return and over time raise the cost of capital to companies 

 essentially the critics of stock-index futures fall into two camps 

 one group says the futures contribute to stock market volatility the other contends that futures are a <unk> of speculation that <unk> from the stock market 's basic function of raising capital 

 before futures says new york investor michael <unk> you actually had to pay attention to whether the thing you were buying had any <unk> value 

 while it was once expected that futures would mimic stock prices traders now routinely check the futures markets in chicago before they buy or sell stocks 

 when chicago futures prices jump up or down the new york stock exchange follows 

 on tuesday for instance the dow jones industrial average plunged N points in little more than an hour 

 then in the space of a <unk> coffee break the average rallied almost all of the way back 

 paul <unk> who manages more than $ N billion of investments at <unk> capital management inc. blames futures markets for leading the way 

 the fundamentals do n't change in an hour he says 

 i think they should close down the futures exchange and then we could get back to investing 

 index arbitrage the <unk> buying and selling of stocks offset with opposite trades in futures is frequently blamed for adding to stock market volatility 

 although index arbitrage is said to add liquidity to markets john <unk> managing partner of edward d. jones says too much liquidity is n't a good thing 

 the kind of instant liquidity that is implied by index futures is that you can buy a portfolio over two years and get out in one day 

 it 's too <unk> he says 

 it is n't investing 

 but stock-index futures have plenty of support 

 defenders say futures make markets more efficient and provide ways for investors to reduce risks 

 they note that stocks experienced volatile swings long before futures 

 and defenders say few people complain about futures when stock prices are rising 

 louis <unk> managing director in charge of equity options and futures at salomon inc. says that trading baskets of stocks began in the 1970s a decade before the advent of futures 

 futures he says merely cut down on trading costs 

 he says blaming futures is like blaming the <unk> 

 since stock-index arbitrage merely narrows the gap between prices in the futures and stock markets it ca n't add to volatility he says 

 futures do n't need defending says andrew <unk> a spokesman for the chicago mercantile exchange which trades the s&p N by far the largest stock-index futures contract 

 despite the current outcry over stock market volatility few people expect stock futures to disappear 

 for one thing the chicago futures exchanges have political and financial clout including many friends in congress 

 and traders say that futures have become an accepted part of the financial landscape 

 all life is about change either you <unk> or die says one chicago futures trader 

 if futures are n't permitted here we 'll take it to australia or tokyo 

 average daily volume in s&p N futures last year was N contracts 

 based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion 

 by contrast average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ N billion 

 many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios 

 if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts 

 average daily volume in s&p N futures last year was N contracts 

 based on yesterday 's closing price of the s&p the average value of one day 's trading amounts to $ N billion 

 by contrast average dollar volume on the big board last year was $ N billion 

 many investment managers say futures are useful as a way to hedge portfolios 

 if managers fear that the overall stock market will fall but want to continue owning stocks they can hold on to specific stocks and sell a corresponding amount of futures contracts 

 and although criticism of futures generally comes from wall street one chicago futures trader notes that brokerage firms rely on futures as hedging tools when they buy and sell big blocks of stocks from institutions 

 one reason futures are said to add volatility is that unlike in stocks people can speculate in futures with little money down 

 margin requirements for speculators on the chicago mercantile exchange are currently about N N 

 for $ N million you can move $ N million of stocks a specialist on the big board <unk> 

 that gives futures traders a lot more power 

 by contrast an investor in stocks must put up N N in cash 

 some critics say futures encourage people to think of stocks as a single commodity rather than as investments in individual businesses 

 thus they say futures inhibit the basic purpose of the stock market to accurately price securities so that capital and investment flows where it 's needed most 

 the s&p N index futures transferred the identity of N stocks into one unit making them a simple commodity to trade says george <unk> senior vice president at a. webster <unk> in philadelphia 

 it took away the need to know the bad third-quarter report of ibm for example mr. <unk> says 

 of course portfolio trading the increasingly common practice of buying or selling baskets of actual stocks also <unk> stocks as <unk> commodities 

 there is a class of investor that wants to be exposed to the whole market says <unk> <unk> assistant vice president at travelers investment management co 

 the s&p futures are merely a cheaper and <unk> way to get access to all N stocks he says 

 the big board yesterday began trading in its own basket trading vehicle representing the s&p N stocks 

 but owning index futures is n't the same as owning the underlying stocks 

 stockholders as a group can win because they own a share of corporate earnings which can grow and boost stock prices 

 futures on the other hand are a zero sum game a market for making side bets about the direction of stock prices 

 you do n't own anything says stephen boesel a money manager for t. rowe price in baltimore 

 you 're making a pure bet on the market 

 the european community commission challenged an agreement on routes and fares between france 's two largest airlines on antitrust grounds 

 meeting in <unk> wednesday the commission voted as expected to formally object to the accord between air france the state-owned airline and state-controlled domestic carrier air <unk>

 at issue is an accord dating back to march in which air france gained access to five domestic french routes under air <unk> 's flight numbers and the domestic airline got to fly to five cities outside of france under the flag of air france 

 the two shared results from this route swap and followed rules on ticket pricing 

 the ec commission decided that such an accord does n't benefit consumers enough to merit an exemption from antitrust law

 general motors corp. wants to buy as much as N N of jaguar plc marking its first <unk> in a possible <unk> battle against ford motor co. for control of the british car maker 

 gm sought u.s. antitrust clearance last week to purchase more than $ N million worth of jaguar shares but does n't own any yet according to gm officials here and at the company 's detroit headquarters 

 the no. N u.s. auto maker then wrote jaguar that it intends to go to that N N level once it wins the u.s. clearance to go beyond $ N million a jaguar spokesman said yesterday 

 the gm move follows tuesday 's declaration by ford which holds an unwelcome N N stake in jaguar that it is prepared to bid for the entire company 

 gm is close to completing a friendly deal with jaguar that is likely to involve an eventual N N stake and joint manufacturing ventures 

 speculative investors betting on an imminent clash between ford and gm pushed up jaguar 's share price five pence eight u.s. cents to a <unk> N pence $ N in late trading on london 's stock exchange yesterday 

 since tuesday the shares have gained nearly N N 

 but an <unk> bidding war between the world 's top auto giants for britain 's leading luxury-car maker seems unlikely 

 we will not go over a certain level said david n. <unk> ford 's vice president for finance at a news conference yesterday in dearborn mich 

 there 's some price at which we 'd stop bidding 

 he would n't specify what it was 

 and powerful political pressures may convince the conservative government to keep its so-called golden share which limits any individual holding to N N until the restriction expires on dec. N N 

 i really do n't see the government doing something that jaguar does n't want over the next N months said kenneth warren a conservative member of parliament and chairman of the select committee on trade and industry in britain 's house of commons 

 the golden share is a single share but it is the magic share 

 the government retained the single share after selling its stake in jaguar in N part of a <unk> practice of protecting former government-owned enterprises to <unk> criticism of privatization 

 the N N restriction covers any would-be suitor british or foreign 

 ford is willing to bid for N N of jaguar 's shares if both the government and jaguar shareholders agree to relax the anti-takeover barrier <unk> 

 as jaguar 's biggest holder and britain 's biggest car maker ford could turn up the heat by <unk> a special shareholders ' meeting and urging holders to drop the limits early 

 ford might succeed because many shareholders are speculators keen for a full bid or institutional investors unhappy over jaguar management 's handling of its current financial difficulties 

 the government probably would n't give in readily to a hostile <unk> by ford however 

 it has <unk> a golden share only once before during british petroleum co. 's # N billion $ N billion takeover of <unk> plc in N 

 in wooing british lawmakers gm has pointed out that its willingness to settle for a minority stake would keep jaguar <unk> and independent 

 this week the u.s. auto giant paid for N house of commons members and two house of <unk> members to fly to detroit and tour its operations there 

 while the visit was unrelated to jaguar gm chairman roger smith answered the legislators ' questions about it over lunch tuesday 

 he said jaguar should n't be <unk> by anyone else recalled one participant 

 politics also influences the government 's thinking on the anti-takeover restriction 

 the conservatives do n't <unk> jeopardize marginal <unk> seats in <unk> where jaguar has headquarters nor can the government easily back down on promised protection for a privatized company while it proceeds with controversial plans to <unk> most of britain 's water and electricity industries 

 prime minister margaret thatcher might however be <unk> to any request by jaguar chairman sir john <unk> for the restriction 's early removal to let gm <unk> more than N N or mount a friendly suitor bid against ford 

 in the end sir john rather than the government or jaguar shareholders may hold the key that <unk> the golden share

 latin american markets continued their recovery after a weak start to the year skf said 

 the company said the situation in the u.s. is still uncertain as reduced production in the country 's automotive industry has resulted in weakened demand for rolling bearings 

 analysts said skf 's results for the first nine months lived up to market expectations as brokerage firms had predicted a pretax profit of N billion to N billion kronor 

 the three business areas engaged in rolling bearing operations continued to show favorable sales development 

 sales of rolling bearings increased N N to N billion kronor from N billion kronor in the corresponding period the previous year 

 we read with interest robert <unk> 's sept. N page-one article on robert redford the <unk> kid gets little respect around <unk> 

 <unk> conversations with us mr. <unk> argued that mr. redford 's environmental views are at odds with utah residents 

 this may have been true N years ago but times have changed even in utah 

 mr. redford no longer stands out as an <unk> 

 he has not changed but those around him have 

 many of his views on the protection of <unk> areas <unk> and <unk> are now embraced by mainstream conservative <unk> 

 recently some N environmental and <unk> groups representing such <unk> points of view as the sierra club the league of women voters and the national <unk> association joined together to request a <unk> of the environmentally <unk> central utah project 

 while utah is not yet a haven for environmentalism public views toward the environment have significantly improved 

 in one of the most conservative republican states in the entire nation the <unk> of robert redford 's neighbors is the real story that mr. <unk> missed 

 <unk> <unk> sam <unk> gary <unk> <unk> city utah 

 if mr. redford wanted to be accepted by the people of utah he should have taken an advisory role instead of one of forcing his personal preferences 

 furthermore his actions <unk> that it is too damaging or costly for society to provide jobs through <unk> construction coal mining or to build roads for public safety because of the adverse impact on the environment but it is just fine and <unk> for him to transform a mountain high in the <unk> range into a ski resort 

 it <unk> me he can <unk> his <unk> and greedy actions in utah 

 an excellent environmental actor he is

 mr. redford like it or not is like a <unk> system on a runaway truck kind of slowing it down into control 

 he 's rich famous and <unk> and has the time to do something that not even the federal government will do 

 mr. redford is slowing down a <unk> speeding <unk> known as the progress of <unk> 

 personally i 'm glad there are people like him around to slow down the profit <unk> and those who are in such a blind hurry for something that may appear to benefit them in the immediate future not <unk> about the <unk> implications

 when president bush <unk> to costa rica today he 'll go with little of the fanfare that <unk> many of his foreign <unk> 

 but the two-day trip still has managed to fuel controversy over his administration 's policies in central america 

 some conservatives say mr. bush should n't make the trip during which he will participate in costa rica 's celebration of N years of democracy 

 these critics object to mr. bush 's participation in a meeting that includes nicaraguan president daniel ortega among the guests 

 in addition they argue he wo n't help washington 's standing in the region by <unk> the u.s. commitment to democracy less than a month after his administration played an <unk> role in the failed coup attempt in panama 

 i believe it will do more damage than good because it will <unk> people like daniel ortega says <unk> windsor who served as u.s. ambassador to costa rica during the reagan administration 

 mr. windsor among other analysts connected to the conservative heritage foundation fears the gathering of N leaders mostly from central american nations will force mr. bush to explain and redeem himself in the wake of charges that the u.s. failed to do enough to aid the removal of panamanian dictator manuel noriega 

 at the same time liberal and moderate democrats note the irony of mr. bush 's joining a celebration of costa rican democracy at a time his administration has sought sharp cuts in u.s. aid to the tiny country 

 the administration proposed only $ N million in so-called economic support funds for costa rica this year down from the $ N million the u.s. provided last year 

 the administration said improvements in costa rica 's economic condition warrant the cut in aid which the country uses mainly to make payments on its $ N billion foreign debt 

 but costa rican officials argue that the recent drop in coffee prices combined with the country 's continuing struggle to <unk> its economy make the support as necessary as ever 

 we are crossing the river and we need a little more help to get to the other side said <unk> <unk> an economic affairs specialist at the costa rican embassy in washington 

 democrats argue that costa rica deserves more assistance for the same reason that mr. bush is attending the celebration this weekend to reward the country for its stability in a region <unk> with turmoil and for its efforts to promote peace in nicaragua 

 however peace efforts by costa rican president <unk> arias have n't always helped the country 's cause in washington 

 mr. arias 's <unk> refusal to support the u.s. 's campaign against leftist nicaragua earned him the <unk> of the reagan white house 

 and more recently he insisted on signing a <unk> agreement intended to <unk> nicaragua 's <unk> contra rebels faster than the bush administration would prefer 

 i think bush 's going there is a helpful sign said sen. terry sanford d. n.c a member of the foreign relations committee who pushed to provide costa rica about the same amount of aid as it received last year 

 lawmakers in both houses support the higher level 

 administration officials defend mr. bush 's decision to make the trip 

 while they acknowledge the president will attend several meals and a working session also attended by mr. ortega they insist that mr. bush wo n't be extending the nicaraguan leader any special <unk> 

 the administration also made clear its continuing <unk> for the leftist nicaraguan government in recent days <unk> a package of electoral aid to the nicaraguan opposition renewing the u.s. trade <unk> against the country and continuing to complain that the country supports rebel groups in the region 

 officials also insist mr. bush will use the trip to highlight his own initiatives for pushing democracy in the region fighting illegal drugs and <unk> the less developed countries 

 let me say there is a <unk> component to this trip secretary of state james baker told reporters wednesday 

 there wo n't be any formal resolutions or <unk> i do n't think 

 but we still see this as an opportunity to discuss many many very important issues 

 in N the presidents commission of the ncaa which oversees most u.s. <unk> sports contracted with the washington-based american institutes for research to do a survey on the college <unk> of what the body chooses to call <unk> 

 a brief executive summary was issued last april and attracted some but not much attention 

 <unk> reports followed and attracted even less notice 

 i suspect i may be one of the few people to have read them all 

 the sixth and last report now is out and it puts the effort in perspective 

 titled comments from students it focuses on the real shame of college sports what happens to young athletes once they enter <unk> 

 it 's little less than a cry for help from those who make the costly show possible 

 the previous five reports were mainly statistical but clear enough in <unk> 

 they showed that participants in division i football and men 's basketball the big-time revenue sports entered school with poorer high-school grades and test scores than <unk> <unk> and students who participated in other <unk> activities and they got lower grades once they got there at least partly because of the athletic demands placed on them 

 the football and basketball players spent more time on their sports in season than they did on class attendance and <unk> combined N hours a week <unk> N 

 almost half N N reported suffering mental abuse from coaches and almost <unk> N N said they had been pressured to ignore injuries 

 but even those numbers do n't describe the situation as well as the athletes do in their own words 

 the composite portrait that emerges is n't of a <unk> <unk> marking time until he can land a <unk> pro contract he 's part of a tiny minority 

 rather it 's of a kid we 're talking about N to N year <unk> here having a tough time making the best of what will probably be his one shot at college 

 the <unk> question coming at the end of a lengthy confidential <unk> was this are there things about your college life you would like to tell us that we did n't ask about 

 of the almost N athletes surveyed N took the time to respond 

 here are a few of their answers they say that i am a <unk> but really i 'm an <unk> 

 they <unk> to me on the recruiting trip 

 football is the no. N thing here 

 junior football player 

 being a <unk> at college is a lot different from high school 

 first the sport you play is no longer a game it becomes a job 

 your coaches demand a lot more out of you even though some of them are not willing to take the time to watch you progress 

 you become <unk> 

 your interest is not taken to heart because people only care about your performance 

 freshman basketball player 

 the coaches should have a more personal and sympathetic attitude toward the athletes not treat us like pieces of meat 

 they always say to get a degree first but they do n't allow us time or to <unk> practice to study for a test 

 they just want to get their job done at any cost to the <unk> 

 freshman football player 

 the pressure put on us to win at all times has resulted in physical violence such as <unk> and <unk> by coaches 

 some days the coaches make you feel as though you are part of a large <unk> of animals 

 in other words they treat you like a piece of meat 

 <unk> football player 

 playing <unk> sports does n't give you a lot of time to spend with others 

 we are almost left out of campus social activities 

 this mostly happens because we go from football in the fall to lifting in the winter to football again in the spring 

 freshman football player 

 you talk about free time <unk> free time 

 time to relax and enjoy ourselves is always taken up by something to do with football meetings lifting <unk> <unk> or films 

 there is no recovery period it 's go go go 

 abuse to our bodies is overwhelming 

 with our schedule it 's hard to sleep well knowing what is going to happen the next day 

 junior football player 

 physical <unk> and depression are common in my life and in some of my <unk> ' lives 

 football player class unspecified 

 more often than not college athletes go through college never really experiencing <unk> life to the <unk> 

 one has to establish one 's own identity away from athletics and make athletics only a part not a whole of the <unk> 's life 

 <unk> basketball player 

 somehow and i do n't know how the game needs to be played for fun again and not for the big bowl revenues or lucrative tv contracts 

 <unk> football player 

 there have been <unk> that at long last changes may be in the works 

 the knight foundation of <unk> ohio has established a national commission to look into <unk> reform and the ncaa presidents commission earlier this month recommended cutting spring football practice in half moving the start of basketball practice back by a month and reducing maximum schedules in that sport to N games from N 

 the key word in that <unk> though is may 

 ncaa executive director richard <unk> in accepting a place on the knight commission urged that the panel take a balanced view which looks for all the world like a plea not to rock the boat too much and the presidents ' recommendations could face considerable opposition at the ncaa 's full convention in january which will vote on them 

 i read that one <unk> athletics director predicted that the <unk> proposal could fail because of real world <unk> economic considerations 

 but the real world also includes the <unk> truth that colleges are cheating the athletes they have <unk> and won 

 if they wo n't change their ways voluntarily maybe somebody bigger congress should make them 

 they want <unk> <unk> to the <unk> labs 

 they want a 24-hour library 

 and like college <unk> everywhere they are talking about a demonstration where protesters would gather quietly near the science building and raise their hands classroom style 

 such is the fiber of the <unk> that <unk> intellectuals let fly at <unk> of harvard university 's new society of <unk> and <unk> or song 

 <unk> are mad as <unk> about campus <unk> and they are n't going to take it anymore at least not without trying a few really neat ideas first 

 we could have called ourselves the academic intellectual society but then everyone would have said oh you mean the <unk> club <unk> <unk> song 's <unk> adviser told N <unk> at the club 's <unk> meeting earlier this month 

 membership has since swelled to between N and N 

 some people may think of <unk> as <unk> <unk> <unk> individuals with <unk> <unk> for their pencils and a <unk> with computers and matters <unk> 

 <unk> by at least one definition are <unk> circus <unk> 

 but song founder <unk> <unk> a harvard junior thinks of <unk> and <unk> more as <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> 

 one of the group 's first projects is a <unk> hot line that students could call when they have an urge to delay studying 

 the club plans to show <unk> movies such as real <unk> in which physics <unk> pop corn with <unk> and naturally the <unk> of the <unk> a tale of college males with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> 

 one of its more ambitious goals is to get <unk> <unk> the los angeles high-school <unk> teacher featured in the film stand and deliver to come to harvard for a guest <unk> 

 <unk> and <unk> sometimes find themselves a bit isolated at harvard 

 so mr. <unk> says high priority is being given to creating a computerized <unk> service where instead of being matched for eye color you could be matched for similar intellectual interests 

 for instance 

 i 'm a <unk> major but i want to know about <unk> 

 hopefully i 'd find someone in <unk> who wanted to know more about <unk> 

 it could work 

 meanwhile finding a volunteer to write the computer program is n't a problem 

 <unk> savings bank of new york was cleared by the federal deposit insurance corp. to acquire <unk> savings bank of <unk> n.j. the banks said

 environmental concerns are beginning to have as much influence in <unk> spending plans as the price of crude does 

 in the wake of the exxon <unk> spill in march new <unk> drilling bans are sharply <unk> exploration in promising locations offshore and in alaska 

 at the same time moves toward tighter <unk> standards are spurring interest in lighter or alternative fuels that do n't <unk> as much as fuel refined from heavy <unk> generally high in <unk> 

 over the years the world 's stream of oil has been growing heavier 

 so the scramble is on for lighter <unk> <unk> and for natural gas in the u.s. 

 recently saudi arabia and venezuela traditional <unk> producers have <unk> of new finds of light <unk> oil by their national oil companies 

 venezuela has also earmarked $ N million in new money for <unk> exploration 

 and some oil companies are trying to lock in future supplies 

 typical is <unk> <unk> <unk> italy 's state-owned energy company which not long ago acquired through its agip oil subsidiary a N N share in the consortium accounting for half of <unk> 's oil output 

 agip already has an oil stake in libya 

 both countries produce high-quality <unk> <unk> especially <unk> to making <unk> motor fuel at minimum refining cost 

 franco <unk> <unk> chairman looks for sweeping structural change in the oil industry he calls it a revolution requiring huge investments as a result of environmental issues 

 he made a special trip to examine u.s. environmental trends because they are often followed in europe 

 <unk> needs to know what 's coming as it prepares to spend some $ N billion on upgrading its refineries he says 

 oil companies world-wide will have to spend a lot of money for the cleaner fuels that will be required says john h. <unk> the president of the petroleum industry research foundation 

 it will go for work ranging from refinery <unk> to changes in the distribution system including the way service stations pump fuel into cars 

 in the u.s. the search for oil had been headed toward environmentally sensitive areas believed to have vast reserves 

 alaska 's arctic national wildlife refuge alone is thought to hide more than three billion barrels of oil 

 until the tanker spill big oil was slowly convincing authorities it could <unk> produce from such places 

 now the wildlife refuge has been closed to the industry possibly for years 

 similarly a group of companies led by chevron corp. has been unable to pump oil found off the california coast in the early 1980s 

 a huge production system built in the sea off santa barbara and <unk> is sitting idle 

 but the push for cleaner fuels is increasing the <unk> of natural gas 

 more than half the domestic drilling now under way is for gas partly on the assumption that demand will rise for a fuel that is cleaner to <unk> than either oil or coal 

 activity has revived in the largest u.s. <unk> regions such as the gulf of mexico 

 santa fe international corp. which is owned by kuwait and is n't related to santa fe southern pacific 's unit is stepping up development of a well off texas ' <unk> island where it found gas in N 

 we could have sat on it longer but the impetus is to get the gas to the marketplace says richard <unk> senior <unk> for santa fe international 

 we 're trying to get it on line as soon as possible now 

 this month exxon corp. announced plans for a <unk> project drilling for gas about five miles underground in the <unk> basin of western oklahoma the <unk> drilling project in the u.s. 

 exxon will use a parker drilling co. rig built in N that can go down N N miles 

 as the soviet union <unk> with its worsening economy leading reformers have drawn up a blueprint for change designed to push the nation much closer to a free-market system 

 the proposals go far beyond the current and rather confused policies of perestroika mikhail gorbachev 's restructuring of the economy 

 they lay out a clear timetable and <unk> for <unk> the system of setting prices breaking up huge industrial monopolies and putting unprofitable state-owned companies out of business 

 they also address such <unk> subjects as the likelihood of unemployment and high inflation and recommend ways to soften the social consequences 

 while many solutions to the nation 's economic troubles are being discussed the blueprint is attracting widespread attention here because of its <unk> and presumed <unk> <unk> 

 although it was published <unk> in the latest edition of the weekly <unk> <unk> soviet sources say the article was written by <unk> <unk> and a small group of colleagues 

 mr. <unk> head of the academy of science 's institute of economics was recently appointed deputy chairman of the soviet government and head of a state commission on economic reform 

 it 's clearly a <unk> for the next stage of perestroika said one analyst 

 the economic ideas in the document are much <unk> than current policies 

 for example the proposed overhaul of prices an extremely sensitive political topic is far more precise than the vague plans announced by mr. gorbachev in N and later dropped 

 but the proposals also display political <unk> <unk> some of the most controversial ideas in cautious language so as not to <unk> powerful conservatives in the government who stand to lose out if they are implemented 

 seeking a middle path between opponents of change and <unk> who demand overnight solutions the article advocates what it calls a <unk> approach 

 the document is to be discussed at a conference of leading economists late this month and will probably be presented to the soviet parliament for consideration this year 

 as <unk> draw up proposals for the next five-year plan which starts in N the blueprint represents a powerful first shot in what is likely to be a fierce battle over economic reform 

 the authors make a gloomy assessment of the economy and concede that quick and easy <unk> to success simply do n't exist 

 instead they <unk> out a strategy in several <unk> from now until N 

 most of the measures would probably only start to have an effect on beleaguered soviet consumers in two to three years at the earliest 

 the key steps <unk> include property 

 rigid ideological restrictions on property ownership should be abandoned 

 the document proposes breaking up the <unk> system of state-owned enterprises and farms and allowing a big private sector to <unk> helped by tough <unk> legislation 

 the economy would be thrown open to numerous types of ownership between now and N including factories leased by workers or owned by shareholders cooperatives and joint ventures 

 some forms of private property would be <unk> 

 such moves would greatly reduce the power of government ministries who now <unk> guard their turf and are seen as one of the major obstacles blocking economic reform 

 finances 

 emergency measures would be introduced to ease the country 's financial crisis notably its $ N billion budget deficit 

 by the end of next year all <unk> state enterprises would be put out of business or handed over to workers who would buy or lease them or turn them into cooperatives 

 similar steps would be taken to liquidate unprofitable state and collective farms by the end of N 

 a unified system of taxation should be introduced rapidly 

 to <unk> up some of the N billion rubles in circulation the government should encourage home ownership including issuing bonds that guarantee holders the right to purchase an apartment 

 labor 

 a genuine market for labor and wages would replace the present rigid <unk> system 

 <unk> from decades of soviet <unk> the new system would lead to big differences in pay between workers and almost certainly to unemployment 

 to cushion the <unk> the government would introduce a minimum wage and unemployment benefits 

 prices 

 the entire system of <unk> set prices would be <unk> and free-market prices introduced for most wholesale trade and some retail trade 

 consumers would still be able to buy some food and household goods at subsidized prices but luxury and imported items including food would be sold at market prices 

 wholesale prices would be divided into three categories raw materials sold at fixed prices close to world levels <unk> procurement prices for a small number of key products and free prices for everything else to be determined by contracts between suppliers and purchasers 

 inflation-adjusted social benefits would ensure that the poor and elderly do n't suffer <unk> 

 foreign trade 

 the current <unk> and <unk> of foreign trade would be taken much further 

 soviet companies would face fewer obstacles for exports and could even invest their hard currency abroad 

 foreigners would receive greater incentives to invest in the u.s.s.r. 

 alongside the current <unk> ruble a second currency would be introduced that could be freely exchanged for dollars and other western currencies 

 a domestic foreign exchange market would be set up as part of an overhaul of the nation 's banking system 

 the blueprint is at its <unk> when referring to the fate of the two powerful economic institutions that seem likely to oppose such sweeping plans the state planning committee known as <unk> and the state committee for material supply or <unk> 

 but it hints strongly that both organizations would increasingly lose their clout as the changes particularly the introduction of wholesale trade and the breakup of state monopolies take effect 

 ready willing and unable i always lift the <unk> when my car does n't start if <unk> at home do n't work i <unk> take them apart

 john <unk> 

 albert engelken and robert thomson had never met though for N years their lives had been <unk> in a way <unk> to the sports world 

 mr. engelken now a <unk> executive in washington d.c. and mr. thomson a <unk> salesman in <unk> n.j. had n't even talked to each other 

 but one recent day they became much closer 

 mr. engelken a <unk> baseball fan <unk> over the sports pages to chart the <unk> of my favorite and <unk> teams and players 

 he often <unk> he says at the clutter of sports stories about drugs alcohol gambling and some player 's <unk> about the <unk> millions he is offered to play the game 

 his morning paper the washington post even carries a sports column called <unk> that <unk> the latest <unk> and convictions of players and team managers 

 like many sports <unk> mr. engelken has turned <unk> 

 but his is a story about a hero in an era of sports <unk> and about what <unk> ruth mr. engelken <unk> us once called the only real game in the world 

 to mr. engelken it is also a story about love because i 'm <unk> to have a wife who still thinks her slightly <unk> husband 's <unk> birthday deserves the ultimate present 

 to understand what mr. engelken means one must go back to a <unk> october afternoon in N at new york 's <unk> grounds stadium where it can be argued the most dramatic moment in baseball history was played out 

 it was the ninth inning of the third game of a <unk> <unk> between the brooklyn <unk> and the new york giants the predecessor to the san francisco giants scheduled to play in tonight 's world series 

 baseball fans throughout new york had <unk> out a long summer with their teams and now it had come to this a battle between the two for the national league <unk> down to the last inning of the last game no less 

 some N fans <unk> the stands and shouted at the top of their <unk> 

 mr. engelken was doing the same across the hudson river in new jersey where with his nose pressed against the front window of the <unk> national bank he watched the <unk> on a television set the bank set up for the event 

 the <unk> series had <unk> the <unk> giants fan 

 the giants struck first winning the <unk> N on a <unk> homer off <unk> <unk> ralph <unk> mr. engelken recalls with precision today 

 the giants got <unk> in the second game N and trailed N going into the bottom of the ninth of the third and deciding game 

 the giants scored once and had <unk> on second <unk> <unk> and third <unk> <unk> as bobby thomson advanced to the plate 

 the rest as they say is history 

 mr. thomson a tall <unk> <unk> <unk> stepped into the <unk> 's box 

 thomson took a called strike mr. engelken <unk> 

 the tension mounted as ralph <unk> again on the <unk> <unk> down the <unk> 

 he wound up and let loose a <unk> 

 the pitch <unk> toward bobby thomson high and inside and then with a crack of the bat was sent <unk> back into the lower <unk> stands 

 giants fans went into euphoria says mr. engelken 

 and bobby thomson was made a <unk> 

 the same bobby thomson it turns out who sells those <unk> today 

 there ca n't be an older baseball fan alive who does n't clearly remember that bobby thomson homer who ca n't tell you where he was when he heard the famous <unk> <unk> radio broadcast the one that concluded with mr. <unk> shouting over and over the giants win the <unk> the giants win the <unk> 

 mr. engelken and mr. thomson drifted in different <unk> in the subsequent years and the <unk> grounds located under <unk> 's <unk> in upper manhattan was replaced by a <unk> project 

 mr. thomson played <unk> and third base until N posting a lifetime N <unk> average and <unk> up N home runs before retiring and going into <unk> sales 

 mr. engelken moved south to washington but he took with him <unk> memories of the homer of N 

 when his wife <unk> came down the <unk> on their <unk> day in N mr. engelken no <unk> on the romantic front gave her the ultimate <unk> you look <unk> than bobby thomson 's home run 

 the couple 's first dog homer was named after the great event though <unk> friends assumed he was the <unk> of the <unk> 

 and when mr. engelken 's sister <unk> who was born two days before the home run reached her <unk> birthday mr. engelken wrote his sports hero to tell him of the <unk> of events 

 mr. thomson sent off a card to <unk> it does n't seem like N years since i hit that home run to <unk> your birth it read 

 <unk> was pleased but nowhere near as much as mr. engelken 

 the family license plate reads <unk> N the first three letters of the family name and no surprise here bobby thomson 's uniform number 

 and on mr. engelken 's <unk> birthday his wife bought a book detailing the big homer and sent it off to mr. thomson to be <unk> 

 what could have been better asks mr. engelken 

 <unk> engelken asked the same question earlier this year when her husband was about to turn N 

 she had an idea 

 on her husband 's <unk> birthday after an <unk> N years of marriage it should be noted <unk> al and their <unk> son set out for new york to visit <unk> university 

 mrs. engelken had scheduled a stop on the new jersey turnpike to she told her husband pick up some papers for a neighbor 

 the papers would be handed over at a bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N 

 it sounded like something out of ian fleming mr. engelken recalls 

 at the appointed exit the family pulled over and mrs. engelken went to get her papers 

 mr. engelken turned off the motor and rolled down the window 

 in a matter of minutes she was back with a tall <unk> man in <unk> 

 she <unk> down by the car window and addressed her husband with her favorite <unk> 

 <unk> she said happy <unk> birthday 

 this is bobby thomson 

 and there he was recalls mr. engelken 

 the hero of my youth the one person in history i 'd most like to meet 

 keep your thomas <unk> or st. <unk> or <unk> i 'd take baseball 's flying <unk> without <unk> 

 they talked of the home run 

 i thought it was in the upper deck said bobby thomson now N years old 

 they talked of the aftermath 

 i never thought it would become so <unk> bobby <unk> 

 mr. engelken says his wife was <unk> by the whole thing 

 it was worth it just for the look on albert 's face 

 the two men spent an hour at exit N <unk> the event <unk> the <unk> dream of a young boy now turned N mr. engelken says 

 his hero signed photographs of the homer and <unk> called ralph <unk> a very fine <unk> 

 and when mr. engelken asked him why he took time off from work for somebody he did n't even know bobby thomson replied you know albert if you have the chance in life to make somebody this happy you have an obligation to do it 

 in an interview mr. thomson who is married and has three grown children says he has few ties to baseball these days other than playing <unk> games now and again 

 but his fans to his constant <unk> never let him forget the famous <unk> 

 his mail regularly recalls my one event and has been growing in recent years 

 in response to the letters mr. thomson usually sends an <unk> photo with a <unk> note and rarely <unk> a <unk> 

 but when <unk> engelken wrote him saying she could stop near his new jersey home it seemed different 

 what a good feeling it would be for me to do that he says he thought 

 when the engelken family got back from its trip up north mr. engelken wrote it all down just to make sure no detail was missed 

 on the way home his notes recall it took concentrated effort to keep that car pointed south 

 my mind was miles north at a place called <unk> 's <unk> where a real sports hero had captured the <unk> of a kid who never fully grew up and is all the richer for it 

 take heart sports fans he wrote 

 real heroes exist 

 you might not find one in the <unk> column 

 but who knows 

 you might meet up with him at that bank of telephone <unk> just off exit N of the new jersey turnpike 

 southam inc. said its unprofitable weekly newspaper the financial times of canada is up for sale 

 analysts said the announcement the latest in a series of <unk> and restructuring moves is aimed at improving southam 's earnings before the expiration in june of a standstill pact with <unk> corp 

 when that agreement expires <unk> will be free to increase its N N stake in southam or to make an offer for the whole company 

 <unk> of the southam family hold an additional N N stake in the toronto-based company canada 's largest newspaper publisher 

 the newspaper could fetch between N million and N million canadian dollars us$ N million to $ N million said one analyst who asked not to be identified 

 a spokesman for southam declined to comment on the price the company is seeking or on estimates of the paper 's annual losses which most analysts place at between c$ N million and c$ N million 

 yesterday southam reported third-quarter earnings of c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million down from c$ N million on revenue of c$ N million in the year-ago quarter 

 to be profitable the paper requires more circulation and building circulation is an expensive undertaking said john <unk> the paper 's publisher 

 southam said the level of future investment required by the paper would have restricted its options in other areas 

 the acquisition of the financial times of canada is well within reach for any number of media companies both public and private said james <unk> an analyst with toronto-based <unk> james capel inc 

 possible bidders include christopher <unk> a toronto financier and vice chairman of hees international bancorp inc. a holding company controlled by toronto 's bronfman family 

 mr. <unk> sold his stake in <unk> corp. to hees earlier this year and is said to be seeking a media acquisition 

 mr. <unk> could n't be reached for comment but roy <unk> chairman of <unk> media a closely held concern that publishes two business magazines said his company would take a close look at the newspaper 

 mr. <unk> said the sale of the <unk> financial times which southam has owned since N is consistent with southam 's strategy of cutting costs to obtain maximum profits from its operations while <unk> of <unk> <unk> assets 

 southam agreed to sell its N N stake in <unk> communications ltd. a broadcasting concern to <unk> hunter ltd. for about c$ N million last year 

 this year it has moved to cut costs in its newspaper division through layoffs and asset sales while reaching joint venture and acquisition agreements in other areas 

 the financial times of canada has no links to the british daily newspaper the financial times 

 norton co. said net income for the third quarter fell N N to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or $ N a share 

 operating profit for the <unk> engineering materials and petroleum services concern was $ N million or N cents a share up N N from $ N million or N cents a share 

 the company had a tax credit of $ N million 

 in the year-earlier quarter the tax credit was $ N million 

 sales rose N N to $ N million from $ N million 

 operating profit in the company 's <unk> segment rose N N while operating profit in the engineering materials segment rose N N 

 however the company 's petroleum services segment while profitable was hurt by high financing costs associated with the company 's buy-out of a N N stake in eastman <unk> co. from texas eastern corp. last june 

 norton and texas eastern had each held a N N stake in eastman in a joint venture 

 norton announced earlier this month that it was exploring the possible sale of all or part of eastman <unk> 

 for the nine months norton had net of $ N million or $ N a share and a tax credit of $ N million 

 in the year-earlier period the company had net of $ N million or $ N a share and a tax credit of $ N million 

 norton had operating profit of $ N million or $ N a share up N N from $ N million or $ N a share 

 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 

 <unk> park and her family <unk> for four years to buy a tiny apartment here but found that the closer they got to saving the $ N they originally needed the more the price rose 

 by this month it had more than doubled 

 now the <unk> <unk> whose husband earns a modest salary as an assistant professor of economics is saving harder than ever 

 i am determined to get an apartment in three years she says 

 it 's all i think about or talk about 

 for the parks and millions of other young koreans the <unk> dream of home ownership has become a <unk> illusion 

 for the government it has become a highly volatile political issue 

 last may a government panel released a report on the extent and causes of the problem 

 during the past N years the report showed housing prices increased nearly <unk> 

 the report laid the blame on speculators who it said had pushed land prices up <unk> 

 the panel found that since N real-estate prices rose nearly N N in a speculative fever fueled by economic prosperity the N seoul olympics and the government 's pledge to rapidly develop korea 's southwest 

 the result is that those rich enough to own any real estate at all have boosted their holdings substantially 

 for those with no holdings the prospects of buying a home are ever <unk> 

 in N a quarter of the population owned N N of the nation 's N square <unk> of private land the report said and N N of the population owned N N of the land devoted to housing 

 meanwhile the government 's land bureau reports that only about a third of korean families own their own homes 

 <unk> have soared along with house prices 

 former national <unk> hong <unk> now a radio <unk> says the problem is <unk> for many people 

 i 'm afraid of a popular <unk> if this situation is n't corrected he adds 

 in fact during the past three months there have been several demonstrations at the office complex where the land bureau is <unk> and at the national assembly demanding the government put a stop to real-estate speculation 

 president roh <unk> woo 's administration has been studying the real-estate crisis for the past year with an eye to partial land <unk> 

 last week the government took three bills to the national assembly 

 the proposed legislation is aimed at <unk> some of the <unk> in the current <unk> system 

 <unk> of the bills as currently <unk> are a restriction on the amount of real estate one family can own to N square <unk> in the nation 's six largest cities but more in smaller cities and rural areas 

 the government will <unk> offenders but wo n't <unk> property 

 a tax of between N N and N N on property holdings that exceed the <unk> ceiling 

 taxes of between N N and N N a year on excessive profits from the resale of property or the sale of idle land to the government 

 the government <unk> excessive profits as those above the average realized for other <unk> properties in an area 

 grace periods ranging from two to five years before the full scope of the penalties takes effect 

 the administration says the measures would stem rampant property speculation free more land for the government 's ambitious <unk> program designed to build two million apartments by N and perhaps boost the popular standing of president roh 

 but opposition legislators and others calling for help for south korea 's <unk> say the proposed changes do n't go far enough to make it possible for ordinary people to buy a home 

 some want lower limits on house <unk> others insist on <unk> higher taxation for larger homes and lots 

 the citizens coalition for economic justice a <unk> group leading the charge for radical reform wants restrictions on <unk> high taxation of capital gains and drastic revamping of the <unk> system on which property taxes are based 

 but others large <unk> real-estate developers and business leaders say the government 's proposals are <unk> 

 led by the federation of korean industries the critics are lobbying for the government to weaken its proposed restrictions and penalties 

 government officials who are urging real-estate reforms <unk> at the arguments of business leaders and <unk> at their pressure 

 there is no violation of the <unk> principle of private property in what we are doing says lee <unk> <unk> director of the government 's land bureau which drafted the bills 

 but he adds the constitution <unk> the government to impose some controls to <unk> the shortage of land 

 the land available for housing construction stands at about N square <unk> a person N N lower than in taiwan and only about half that of japan 

 mr. lee estimates that about N property speculators are operating in south korea 

 the chief <unk> he says are big companies and business groups that buy huge amounts of land not for their corporate use but for resale at huge profit 

 one research institute calculated that as much as N N of <unk> land is held by N companies and that as little as N N of that is used for business 

 the government 's office of bank supervision and examination told the national assembly this month that in the first half of N the nation 's N largest business groups bought real estate valued at $ N billion 

 the ministry of finance as a result has proposed a series of measures that would restrict business investment in real estate even more tightly than restrictions aimed at individuals 

 under those measures financial institutions would be restricted from owning any more real estate than they need for their business operations 

 banks investment and credit firms would be permitted to own land equivalent in value to N N of their capital currently the proportion is N N 

 the maximum <unk> property holdings for insurance companies would be reduced to N N of their total asset value down from N N currently 

 but mrs. park acknowledges that even if the policies work to slow or stop speculation apartment prices are unlikely to go down 

 at best she <unk> they will rise more slowly more slowly she hopes than her family 's income 

 <unk> corp. <unk> n.j. declared its initial quarterly of five cents a share payable dec. N to stock of record nov. N 

 the maker of specialty chemicals has about N million shares outstanding 

 the company said the move recognizes its strong financial position 

 although profits were squeezed in N mainly as a result of higher <unk> costs the company said it is confident about future earnings and cash flow for N and beyond 

 in national over-the-counter trading yesterday <unk> shares rose N cents to close at $ N a share 

 the justice department said it is seeking to join a private lawsuit challenging a pittsburgh suburb 's <unk> ordinance that sharply restricts the locations available to group homes for the handicapped 

 this would be the department 's first suit challenging a local <unk> ordinance under N amendments to the fair housing act 

 under those amendments which took effect in march of this year the federal government can intervene in private <unk> lawsuits 

 the ordinance in moon township prohibits <unk> a group home for the handicapped within a mile of another such facility 

 in papers filed with the federal district court in pittsburgh the justice department alleged that the ordinance by limiting the number of group homes that can be established in the township makes housing unavailable on account of <unk> 

 the private suit was brought by three <unk> <unk> people who live in a group home in moon 

 <unk> smith moon township manager said the ordinance is intended to prevent the concentration of group homes for the <unk> <unk> from changing the character and flavor of the neighborhood 

 he said the ordinance also will benefit the <unk> <unk> 

 our intent is to spread them out to insure they are well integrated into the community he said 

 energetic and concrete action has been taken in colombia during the past N days against the <unk> of the drug trade but it has not been sufficiently effective because unfortunately it came too late 

 ten years ago the newspaper el espectador of which my brother <unk> was editor began warning of the rise of the drug <unk> and of their leaders ' aspirations to control colombian politics especially the congress 

 then when it would have been easier to resist them nothing was done and my brother was murdered by the drug <unk> three years ago 

 the most <unk> <unk> have not <unk> their press more <unk> than the drug <unk> <unk> colombia 's 

 the censorship is <unk> through terrorism and assassination 

 in the past N years about N journalists have been <unk> forever murdered 

 within the past two months a bomb exploded in the offices of the el espectador in <unk> destroying a major part of its installations and equipment 

 and only last week the newspaper <unk> liberal in the city of <unk> was <unk> and its installations destroyed 

 journalists and their families are constantly threatened as are the newspaper distribution outlets 

 distribution centers are <unk> and advertisers are <unk> 

 censorship is imposed by terrorism 

 if the colombian media accept this new and <unk> censorship there is little doubt that the drug mafia 's terrorism someday will extend to all the newspapers published in the free world 

 the solidarity of the <unk> media world-wide against drug terrorism is the only way press freedom can survive 

 the american people and their government also <unk> up too late to the <unk> drugs posed to the moral structure of their country 

 even now the american attack upon this tremendous problem is <unk> in <unk> to the magnitude of the threat 

 i can <unk> that a recent colombian <unk> to the u.s. was offered drugs three times in the few blocks ' walk between grand central terminal and the <unk> <unk> hotel in <unk> manhattan 

 colombia alone its government its people its newspapers does not have the capacity to fight this battle successfully 

 all <unk> countries must jointly decide to combat and punish the consumers and distributors of drugs 

 the u.s. as the major drug consumer should lead this joint effort 

 reduction if not the total <unk> of drug consumption is the requirement for victory 

 much is being done in colombia to fight the drug <unk> mafia 

 <unk> homes and <unk> have been <unk> by the military authorities and sophisticated and powerful communications equipment have been seized 

 more than N planes and <unk> have been <unk> at airports and a large number of vehicles and <unk> has been confiscated 

 the military has also captured enormous <unk> of powerful and sophisticated weapons <unk> and other <unk> <unk> 

 much has been accomplished and public opinion <unk> supports the government and the army but on the other hand none of the key drug <unk> have been captured 

 there has been a lot of talk that a large portion of the colombian economy is sustained by the laundering of drug money 

 in my opinion this is not true 

 <unk> drug money has served only to increase <unk> the price of real estate creating serious problems for low-income people who <unk> to own their own homes 

 drug money has also gone to buy expensive cars airplanes <unk> and <unk> where drugs are consumed 

 but most of the drug money is kept in investments and in financial institutions outside colombia 

 in fact the cooperation of those financial institutions is essential to the success of the drug battle 

 what is of much more importance to the colombian economy than the supposed benefits of <unk> drug money is higher prices for colombia 's legitimate products 

 the price of coffee has gone down almost N N since the beginning of the year to the lowest level after inflation since the great depression 

 market conditions point to even lower prices next year 

 the <unk> coffee <unk> had to be formally <unk> this summer 

 as a result colombia will earn $ N million less from its coffee this year than last 

 our coffee growers face reductions in their income and this <unk> them to <unk> <unk> <unk> crops for coffee 

 u.s. interests occasionally try to impose barriers to the import of another important colombian export cut flowers into the american market 

 a just price and an open market for what colombian produces and exports should be the policy of the u.s. 

 i take advantage of this opportunity given to me by the wall street journal to make a plea to the millions of readers of this newspaper to become soldiers dedicated to the fight against the use of drugs 

 each <unk> of cocaine consumed is a deadly bullet against those in our country and in the rest of the world who fight this terrible <unk> 

 a crusade of no to the consumption of drugs is <unk> 

 mr. <unk> is president of el espectador a newspaper founded by his <unk> 

 it has more drug users than boston has people 

 <unk> thousand of its children live in foster homes while N residents have no homes at all 

 its tax base is shrinking a $ N billion budget deficit looms and the city faces contract negotiations with all major municipal unions next year 

 this is new york city 

 when the dust and <unk> settle in an <unk> mayoral race the man most likely to gain custody of all this is a career politician named david dinkins 

 running the nation 's largest and most <unk> city may be no treat but at least mr. dinkins knows what to expect from it 

 as the campaign hits the home stretch however voters still have very little idea what they can expect from him 

 after N years in city politics david dinkins remains an <unk> 

 the <unk> <unk> manhattan borough president the first black man to win the democratic nomination for mayor here does n't have a single prominent political enemy 

 while he is widely described as a man with deep convictions he has few major political programs that he can call his own 

 asked about his greatest achievement in public life he first speaks about the quality of his staff 

 now as election day <unk> even some supporters wonder what he will do if he wins the <unk> on nov. N 

 they wonder whether he can be firm with his longtime allies including union leaders and political <unk> who may seek a place at the trough 

 they wonder whether he has the economic know-how to steer the city through a possible fiscal crisis and they wonder who will be advising him 

 will he if he wins be in the <unk> of the most liberal of his allies who advocate such policies as rent control for commercial buildings or will he tilt toward the real-estate interests that have <unk> money into his campaign 

 after his decisive primary victory over mayor edward i. koch in september mr. dinkins <unk> until recently on a <unk> lead over his republican opponent rudolph giuliani the former crime <unk> who has proved a something of a <unk> as a candidate 

 but mr. dinkins has <unk> in the past two weeks over his campaign 's payments to a black activist who is a convicted <unk> and over his handling of a stock sale to his son 

 polls also have recorded some <unk> in mr. dinkins 's support among jewish voters and <unk> projections now put his lead at between four and N percentage points 

 in an interview with reporters and editors of the wall street journal mr. dinkins appears quite confident of victory and of his ability to handle the <unk> 

 a lot of people think i will give away the store but i can assure you i will not he says 

 i am aware we have real budgetary problems 

 the city is full of aging bridges water <unk> and roadways that are in need of billions of dollars worth of repair 

 renewed efforts to fight drugs and crime will be costly 

 but city officials say tax revenues are lagging 

 and after a decade of explosive job growth on wall street a period of <unk> is under way 

 mr. koch already has announced he will drop N jobs from the city payroll but that wo n't be enough 

 new york state comptroller edward <unk> predicts a $ N billion budget gap for the city 's next fiscal year a gap that could grow if there is a recession 

 if elected mr. dinkins will probably have no choice but to raise taxes on <unk> businesses or cut spending in already <unk> neighborhoods 

 he is going to face a mess says city council president andrew stein 

 his supporters are not <unk> but their solution to everything will be to spend more money and he wo n't have any money 

 by and large mr. dinkins has <unk> the touchy question of whose <unk> he would <unk> 

 instead of focusing on the financial future mr. dinkins has sold himself as a <unk> for a city recently touched by racial violence and as a <unk> <unk> to N years of <unk> generated by mayor koch 

 the thing about the dinkins <unk> is that it offers hope to a broad range of people says <unk> <unk> a real-estate executive and former aide to gov. mario <unk> 

 it is a <unk> <unk> 

 no doubt mr. dinkins has been a <unk> influence 

 he is an <unk> figure who <unk> the <unk> of colleagues ' children opens doors for women and almost never has a bad word to say about anybody 

 more important he emerged as a <unk> last summer after the central park rape of a white <unk> in which a group of <unk> <unk> was charged and the racial murder of a black <unk> in the white brooklyn neighborhood of <unk> 

 rather than scaring off white voters as many predicted he would mr. dinkins attracted many whites precisely because of his reputation for having a cool head 

 keeping cool is a dinkins priority on <unk> days this summer he was known to change his <unk> suits as many as four times a day 

 but even in his <unk> campaign he has shown signs of the <unk> and confusion that some say has plagued his tenure as manhattan borough president and might <unk> him as mayor 

 over the last few weeks he has <unk> away roughly half of what was once a <unk> lead in the polls over mr. giuliani 

 a story about how he <unk> the sale to his son of his stock in a media company controlled by his political <unk> <unk> sutton was allowed to <unk> a full week before mr. dinkins faced the media 

 he has canceled numerous campaign appointments and was largely <unk> to the media until the stock story broke 

 his campaign was caught <unk> amid allegations it paid almost $ N for what it said was a <unk> effort by black activist <unk> carson a convicted <unk> who later said publicly that he is <unk> 

 critics have said the payment looked like an attempt by the dinkins camp to get mr. carson to stop leading <unk> demonstrations <unk> the <unk> murder protests the campaign may have feared could cause some white voters to turn from a black candidate 

 mr. dinkins also has failed to <unk> jewish voters ' fears about his association with the rev. <unk> jackson despite the fact that few local <unk> politicians have been as <unk> for jewish causes in the past N years as mr. dinkins has 

 these campaign problems have <unk> difficulties mr. dinkins has run into before 

 a former u.s. marine mr. dinkins got off to a quick start in politics joining a local democratic political club in the 1950s linking up with black urban leaders such as charles <unk> <unk> paterson and mr. sutton and getting himself elected to the state assembly in N 

 but his chance to become deputy mayor under mayor <unk> <unk> a plan boosted by mr. sutton was <unk> because of mr. dinkins 's failure still largely <unk> to file income tax returns for four years running 

 i always thought of this as a thing that could always be done tomorrow he said at the time 

 later mr. dinkins became more deeply <unk> to mr. sutton and other city <unk> including <unk> council president paul <unk> when they helped him get appointed city clerk a largely <unk> post responsible for the city 's marriage bureau among other things 

 mr. <unk> is now one of the lawyers for mr. sutton 's media company 

 the debt rose further in N when mr. sutton resigned his position as manhattan borough president to run for mayor 

 mr. sutton recalls when i left i sat down with charlie <unk> <unk> paterson and david and david said who will run for borough president and i said you will 

 david <unk> mayor koch 's longtime media adviser says of mr. dinkins he really is the <unk> of the <unk> system 

 but the guy is so personally decent people tend to forget that 

 mr. dinkins lost twice by wide margins before finally getting elected borough president in N 

 but by most accounts he made little of the post and was best known among city politicians for his problems making up his mind on matters before the city 's board of estimate the body that votes on crucial budget and <unk> matters 

 colleagues today recall with some humor how meetings would <unk> into the early morning hours as mr. dinkins would march his staff out of board meetings and into his private office to discuss en <unk> certain controversial proposals 

 he taught me how to drink <unk> tea instead of coffee at N a.m. i 'll give him that says deputy mayor robert <unk> 

 often mr. dinkins 's <unk> prevented him from having a say in the way things turned out critics claim 

 on the campaign <unk> he often points out that he was the only board of estimate member to vote against a controversial real-estate project at manhattan 's columbus circle 

 but board members say he took so long to decide how to vote that by the time he decided it was too late to try to draw other members to his position 

 says one city official everybody else had brought in the <unk> and made their deal 

 he would have got a lot more done if he made up his mind faster 

 one board member bronx borough president ferdinand <unk> was said to be so <unk> with mr. dinkins 's behavior at many meetings that he withheld his support for mr. dinkins 's mayoral effort until late in the primary campaign 

 i had some problem from time to time on the length of time he would take to make up his mind mr. <unk> admits but he maintains that he did n't delay his support of mr. dinkins and that he backs the democratic candidate <unk> 

 mr. dinkins 's campaign manager and former chief of staff bill lynch denies that the manhattan borough president has taken too long to decide important issues 

 we did n't <unk> everything that came to us mr. lynch says 

 on some occasions when mr. dinkins has discussed the issues during the campaign he has run into a familiar kind of trouble 

 some supporters were stunned this summer when mr. dinkins suggested weakening the law <unk> public employees to go on strike 

 he withdrew the remark 

 when he later <unk> with striking hospital workers some allies <unk> a little more concerned that mr. dinkins was setting the wrong tone for coming contract negotiations with city employees 

 then two days before receiving an endorsement from environmental groups mr. dinkins promised he would issue a three-year <unk> on construction of <unk> plants 

 that announcement was <unk> criticized by mayor koch who has endorsed mr. dinkins because the city faces a garbage crisis and has already spent $ N million planning for an incinerator that would be scrapped under mr. dinkins 's proposal 

 while his public statements have at times been confusing mr. dinkins 's position papers have more consistently reflected <unk> sentiment 

 he favors a form of commercial rent control which the financial community believes would make it more difficult to attract investment in the city 

 in the midst of a labor shortage he proposes linking city subsidies to businesses to their record of hiring new york city residents 

 with an <unk> local labor pool many experts believe that policy could drive businesses from the city 

 and he favors a more cooperative approach toward the neighboring states of new jersey and connecticut in the battle over companies thinking of moving employees out of new york city 

 many <unk> officials say the koch administration 's aggressive approach helped save N chase manhattan bank jobs from moving across the hudson 

 but mr. dinkins 's economic <unk> do n't seem to bother the business community where he draws significant support 

 steven <unk> president of the real estate board of new york an industry organization says mr. dinkins 's economic development program is <unk> but when it comes down to it he can be reasonable 

 mr. dinkins 's inner circle of advisers appears to include both <unk> and <unk> leaving voters with little clue as to who will be more influential 

 the key man seems to be the campaign manager mr. lynch 

 a <unk> <unk> son of a long island potato farmer mr. lynch is a veteran union <unk> who worked on the presidential campaigns of sen. edward kennedy and mr. jackson 

 but as the dinkins campaign hit tough times this month andrew <unk> the politically <unk> son of the new york governor is also said to have taken a more active role on strategy 

 another close ally is ruth <unk> a manhattan city <unk> some of whose programs such as commercial rent control have made their way into mr. dinkins 's position papers 

 if she remains influential with mr. dinkins as some suggest she will his <unk> may take on a more <unk> flavor 

 but lincoln center president nathan leventhal who would head a dinkins transition team is more mainstream as is real-estate executive anthony <unk> another insider 

 mr. dinkins also has said he would receive economic advice from a board that would include american express co. chairman james d. robinson iii investment banker <unk> <unk> <unk> specialist <unk> lewis and attorney joseph flom 

 some business leaders and others also believe that mr. dinkins would place significant responsibility in the hands of a deputy mayor with a strong administrative background 

 names of possible deputies that have surfaced include former mayoral candidate richard <unk> former schools chancellor frank <unk> and messrs. leventhal and <unk> 

 then there are mr. dinkins 's <unk> <unk> colleagues such as u.s. rep. <unk> former deputy mayor paterson and mr. sutton 

 having <unk> positions of real influence or wealth these men constitute the old guard of new york city black politics they are less <unk> than the younger more activist black political community that has been based largely in brooklyn 

 part of mr. dinkins 's strength is his ability to win the support of both the brooklyn and <unk> <unk> 

 we know there are <unk> for the city out there says mr. paterson mr. dinkins 's former law partner 

 if any of us think we 're going to <unk> david 's determination to be the best possible mayor because of his obligations to us we are making a sad mistake 

 adds ms. <unk> who is expected to win the borough president 's job mr. dinkins is <unk> you have to remember david is a <unk> 

 but mr. dinkins 's sense of <unk> often comes across more as an insider 's determination not to upset the political apple <unk> 

 he is taken <unk> in an interview when asked whether as mayor he plans on <unk> the political <unk> that <unk> the <unk> <unk> of new york 's school system 

 i will sit down and talk some of the problems out but take on the political system <unk> he says with a shake of the head 

 despite many doubts about his <unk> white new <unk> who gave mr. dinkins N N of their votes in the primary are n't expected to desert in sufficient numbers to turn the election to mr. giuliani 

 the former u.s. attorney who prosecuted targets ranging from mafia <unk> to wall street executives has succeeded in raising questions about mr. dinkins 's ethical standards but so far has failed to generate excitement about his own <unk> 

 as a republican in an <unk> democratic city mr. giuliani has an inherent <unk> 

 as a first-time candidate he has been slow to learn the <unk> of new york city <unk> 

 mr. giuliani is finding that mr. dinkins in his many years in public life has built up considerable good will that so far has led many voters to <unk> certain <unk> 

 the bottom line is that he is a very genuine and decent guy says malcolm <unk> a jewish community leader 

 in the end i think david will be <unk> for being david 

 <unk> johnson pulls a tape measure across the front of what was once a <unk> <unk> home 

 a deep <unk> now runs along its north wall exposed when the house <unk> two feet off its foundation during last week 's earthquake 

 a side <unk> was <unk> away 

 the <unk> is a pile of bricks on the front lawn 

 the remainder of the house <unk> <unk> against a <unk> oak tree 

 the <unk> <unk> ms. johnson dressed in jeans and a <unk> as she <unk> through the steady afternoon rain is a claims adjuster with aetna life & casualty 

 she has been on the move almost <unk> since last thursday when an army of adjusters employed by major insurers <unk> the san francisco area to help policyholders <unk> through the rubble and restore some order to their lives 

 equipped with cellular telephones laptop computers <unk> and a pack of blank checks they parcel out money so their clients can find temporary living quarters buy food replace lost clothing repair broken water <unk> and <unk> walls 

 some of the funds will used to <unk> unstable buildings and clear sites for future construction 

 many adjusters are authorized to write checks for amounts up to $ N on the spot 

 they do n't <unk> at writing them 

 that 's my job get policyholders what they 're entitled to says bill schaeffer a claims supervisor who flew in from aetna 's <unk> conn. office 

 the <unk> house that ms. johnson is <unk> has been deemed <unk> by town officials 

 but she asks a <unk> <unk> the bricks from the lawn to give her a boost through an open <unk> window 

 once inside she spends nearly four hours measuring and <unk> each room in the <unk> house gathering enough information to estimate what it would cost to rebuild it 

 she <unk> photos of the <unk> floors and the <unk> that has fallen away from the walls 

 while she works inside a <unk> returns with several friends to collect furniture and clothing 

 one of the friends <unk> broken <unk> and shattered glass from a <unk> and starts to pack what can be <unk> from the kitchen 

 others grab books records photo <unk> <unk> and chairs working <unk> in the fear that an <unk> will jolt the house again 

 the owners william and <unk> hammack are <unk> than many others 

 a few years ago mrs. hammack insisted on buying earthquake insurance for this house which had been converted into apartments 

 only about N N of california home and business owners carried earthquake coverage 

 the <unk> ' own home also in los <unk> suffered <unk> minor damage 

 ms. johnson who works out of aetna 's office in <unk> creek an east bay suburb is <unk> by the earthquake 's <unk> force 

 it really brings you down to a human level she says 

 it 's hard to accept all the suffering people are going through but you have to 

 if you do n't you ca n't do your job 

 for aetna and other insurers the san francisco earthquake hit when resources in the field already were stretched 

 most companies still are trying to sort through the <unk> caused by hurricane hugo in the carolinas last month 

 aetna which has nearly N adjusters had deployed about N of them in charlotte columbia and charleston 

 adjusters who had been working on the east coast say the insurer will still be processing claims from that storm through december 

 it could take six to nine months to handle the earthquake-related claims 

 when the earthquake rocked northern california last week aetna senior claims executives from the san francisco area were at the company 's hartford conn. headquarters for additional training on how to handle major catastrophes including earthquakes 

 since commercial airline flights were disrupted the company chartered three planes to fly these executives back to the west coast and bring along portable computers cellular phones and some claims adjusters 

 because of the difficulty of assessing the damages caused by the earthquake aetna pulled together a team of its most experienced claims adjusters from around the country 

 even so few had ever dealt with an earthquake 

 some adjusters like alan singer of san diego had been working in charleston for nearly four weeks 

 he returned home last thursday packed a bag with fresh clothes and reported for duty friday in <unk> creek 

 offices were set up in san francisco and san jose 

 in a few <unk> aetna knew it would probably be <unk> out big <unk> even before a client called or <unk> in a claim 

 for example officials at <unk> creek office learned that the <unk> hotel near the san francisco airport which is insured by aetna was badly damaged when they saw it on network television news 

 the secret to being a good adjuster is counting says <unk> <unk> an aetna adjuster from santa ana 

 you have to count everything 

 adjusters must count the number of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> 

 but they must also <unk> a price to each of these items as well as to floors <unk> <unk> and <unk> to come up with a total value for a house 

 to do that they must think in terms of <unk> by the square foot carpeting by the square yard <unk> by the roll <unk> by the linear foot 

 using a <unk> and a <unk> guide for such jobs as painting plumbing and <unk> in each major region of the country adjusters can figure out the value of a home in today 's market and what it would cost to rebuild it 

 sometimes repairs are out of the question 

 when aetna adjuster bill schaeffer visited a retired couple in oakland last thursday he found them living in a mobile home <unk> in front of their yard 

 the house itself located about N yards from the collapsed section of <unk> highway interstate N was pushed about four feet off its foundation and then collapsed into its <unk> 

 the next day mr. schaeffer presented the couple with a check for $ N to help them build a new home in the same neighborhood 

 he also is working with a real-estate agent to help find them an apartment to rent while their home is being built 

 many of the adjusters employed by aetna and other insurers have some experience with construction work or <unk> 

 but such skills were <unk> to <unk> johnson 

 four years ago she was managing a <unk> shop and was totally <unk> 

 a friend mentioned that she might want to look into a position at aetna if she was interested in a job that would constantly challenge her 

 she signed up starting as an inside adjuster who <unk> minor claims and does a lot of work by phone 

 a year later she moved to the commercial property claims division 

 she spent a month at an aetna school in <unk> pa. learning all about the construction trade including <unk> plumbing and electrical <unk> 

 that was followed by three months at the aetna institute in hartford where she was <unk> in learning how to read and interpret policies 

 her new line of work has some <unk> 

 recently a contractor saved her from falling three stories as she investigated what remained of an old <unk> house <unk> by an <unk> 

 i owe that contractor 

 i really do she says 

 as ms. johnson stands outside the hammack house after <unk> up her chores there the house begins to <unk> and <unk> 

 the ground <unk> <unk> her 

 it is an <unk> one of about N since the earthquake and it makes her uneasy 

 the next day as she prepares a $ N check for the <unk> which will cover the cost of <unk> the house and clearing away the debris she <unk> at the <unk> noise 

 on further reflection she admits that <unk> inside the <unk> ' house the previous day was n't such a great idea 

 during her second meeting with the <unk> ms. johnson reviews exactly what their policy covers 

 they would like to retrieve some appliances on the second floor but wonder if it 's safe to venture inside 

 ms. johnson tells them that if the appliances ca n't be <unk> their policy covers the replacement cost 

 mr. hammack is eager to know what aetna will pay for the house which has to come down 

 when will i get that check for a million dollars he jokes 

 the adjuster had n't completed all the calculations but says we 're talking policy limits 

 in this case that 's about $ N 

 it suddenly <unk> on mr. hammack that rebuilding the house in los <unk> an affluent community in santa clara county may cost more than aetna 's policy will pay 

 we can lose money on this he says 

 and you did n't want me to buy earthquake insurance says mrs. hammack reaching across the table and gently <unk> his hand 

 earthquake insurance costs about $ N to $ N annually for every $ N of value and high <unk> mean it generally pays only when there is a catastrophe 

 so many californians believe they can get by without it 

 even ms. johnson herself made that assumption 

 i always knew that the big one was coming but not during my lifetime she says 

 now she says she 's thinking of <unk> her own insurance agent 

 for ms. johnson dealing with the earthquake has been more than just a work experience 

 she lives in oakland a community hit hard by the earthquake 

 she did n't have hot water for five days 

 the apartment she shares with a <unk> daughter and her sister was rattled books and crystal hit the floor but nothing was severely damaged 

 her sister cynthia wishes <unk> had a different job 

 we worry about her out there cynthia says 

 last sunday ms. johnson finally got a chance to water her plants but stopped abruptly 

 i realized i could n't waste this water when there are people in <unk> who do n't have fresh water to drink 

 she has n't played any music since the earthquake hit out of respect for those who died on interstate N where the roadway collapsed 

 the federal communications commission allowed american telephone & telegraph co. to continue offering discount phone services for <unk> customers and said it would soon <unk> its regulation of the long-distance market 

 the fcc moves were good news for at&t which has been <unk> since the breakup of the phone system for greater <unk> in pricing and reduced regulation 

 alfred <unk> the new fcc chairman <unk> deregulation of at&t at his last job as head of a commerce department telecommunications agency 

 but it has been an open question whether mr. <unk> an extraordinarily cautious man would continue pushing deregulation at the fcc in the face of what is likely to be great political pressure 

 it means that <unk> is serious about the deregulation of long distance said jack <unk> a telecommunications analyst at painewebber inc. who attended the fcc meeting 

 all the commissioners were in amazing agreement to <unk> regulation for only having been together for a few months 

 the fcc took three specific actions regarding at&t 

 by a N vote it allowed at&t to continue offering special discount packages to big customers called tariff N rejecting appeals by at&t competitors that the discounts were illegal 

 then by a separate N vote it chose the <unk> possible grounds to strike down a different discount plan called tariff N that at&t offered to holiday corp 

 at&t gave a N N to N N discount to the memphis tenn. company that oversees holiday <unk> in response to a similar discount offered to holiday corp. by mci communications corp 

 the agency said that because mci 's offer had expired at&t could n't continue to offer its discount plan 

 but the agency specifically did n't rule whether at&t had the right to match offers by competitors if that means giving discounts not generally available to other phone users 

 indeed joe <unk> at&t 's vice president for <unk> services said at&t offered a similar tariff N discount to resort <unk> international of indianapolis to meet another mci bid 

 the fcc did n't say i could n't do it again he said 

 apart from those two actions mr. <unk> and the three other commissioners said they expect to <unk> how at&t is regulated since competition has increased 

 richard <unk> chief of the fcc 's <unk> bureau said he expected the agency to propose new rules next year 

 at&t <unk> the fcc 's actions 

 the time is long overdue to take a look at the fierce competition in the long-distance business and the rules governing it the new york telecommunications firm said in a statement 

 but mci of washington was <unk> with the fcc decision concerning tariff N arguing that at&t can not be allowed to <unk> fcc rules 

 united telecommunications inc. 's us <unk> unit said it was obviously disappointed with the fcc decision on tariff N 

 us <unk> said was it will petition the fcc decision in federal court 

 we believe that the court will find it unlawful said a us <unk> spokesman 

 separately at&t filed a <unk> against mci <unk> it of misleading consumers through allegedly false and deceptive advertising 

 the at&t action was the most recent blow in a nasty fight 

 earlier this month mci sued at&t in federal district court claiming that at&t 's ads are false 

 at&t assembled three of its top executives in washington all <unk> angry to try to <unk> mci 's charges 

 mci has made <unk> out of the upper <unk> of at&t said painewebber 's mr. <unk> who said he expected at&t to become increasingly aggressive in dealing with its longtime <unk>

 billions of investors ' dollars are pouring out of the nation 's junk-bond mutual funds <unk> a <unk> of support in the already reeling junk market 

 last week alone an <unk> $ N billion <unk> out of the junk funds or nearly N N of their total assets according to estimates by <unk> financial services inc. a boston research firm 

 in the past two months the nation 's N junk funds have lost a total of about $ N billion more than N N of assets through sales or transfers of <unk> shares <unk> says 

 it made the estimates based on data collected from more than a dozen big junk funds 

 interviews with three major fund groups fidelity investments vanguard group inc. and t. rowe price associates inc. confirm the trend 

 their junk funds combined have had net outflows totaling nearly $ N million or about N N of their junk fund assets in the past two months 

 some fund managers say negative publicity has <unk> investors ' concern about recent declines in junk-bond prices 

 people have been seeing headline after headline after headline and saying i ca n't take it anymore i 'm getting out says kurt brouwer of brouwer & <unk> a san francisco investment adviser 

 the withdrawals could <unk> trouble for the $ N billion junk market 

 if the heavy outflows continue fund managers will face increasing pressure to sell off some of their junk to pay <unk> investors in the weeks ahead 

 such selling could erode prices of high-yield junk bonds already weakened by a rash of corporate credit problems 

 mutual fund groups have n't lost control of much of the <unk> money says louis <unk> <unk> 's president 

 mutual fund officials say that investors have transferred most of it into their money market accounts and to a lesser extent <unk> funds 

 so the impact on the $ N billion mutual fund industry as a whole probably will be slight 

 but tremors are likely in the junk-bond market which has helped to finance the takeover boom of recent years 

 mutual funds are the among the largest holders of junk accounting for more than a quarter of the entire high-yield high-risk market 

 the N mutual funds investing solely in junk bonds hold assets of about $ N billion 

 other funds hold a <unk> of junk bonds too 

 the $ N billion fidelity high income fund has had a net <unk> of about $ N million in the past two months 

 about $ N million <unk> out last week alone double the level of the week following last month 's campeau corp. credit squeeze 

 about N N of the <unk> was transferred to other fidelity funds says neal <unk> a fidelity vice president marketing with most going into money market funds 

 you get a news item it hits you have strong redemptions that day and for two days following then go back to normal says mr. <unk> 

 the fund with a cash cushion of more than N N has met all the redemptions without having to sell one thing mr. <unk> says 

 he adds our fund has had positive net sales every month for the last three years until this month 

 vanguard 's $ N billion high yield bond portfolio has seen $ N million flow out since early september $ N million of that <unk> out friday oct. N alone 

 still two-thirds of the <unk> has been <unk> into other vanguard portfolios says brian <unk> a vice president 

 the fund now holds a cash position of about N N 

 at the $ N million t. rowe price high yield fund investors <unk> out about $ N million in the past two months 

 those withdrawals most of which were transferred to other t. rowe price funds followed little change in the fund 's sales picture this year through august 

 the last two months have been the whole ball game says steven <unk> a vice president 

 <unk> holders have barely broken even this year as fat interest payments barely managed to offset declining prices 

 through oct. N high-yield funds had an average N N total return the price change plus dividends on fund shares according to lipper analytical services inc 

 that 's even less than the N N total return of the merrill lynch high-yield index 

 fidelity 's junk fund has fallen N N this year through oct. N lipper says the vanguard fund rose N N and the t. rowe price fund edged up N N 

 people who remain in junk funds now could get hit again some analysts and fund specialists say 

 many funds in recent weeks and months have been selling their <unk> junk issues such as rjr nabisco to raise cash to meet expected redemptions 

 funds might be forced to accept lower prices if they expand their selling to the securities of <unk> borrowers 

 and then asset values of the funds could plunge more than they have so far 

 says michael <unk> chief investment officer of republic national bank and manager of the <unk> group in new york it 's a time bomb just waiting to go off 

 the surprise resignation yesterday of british chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson sent sterling into a tailspin against the dollar by creating uncertainties about the direction of the british economy 

 the u.s. unit also firmed against other currencies on the back of sterling 's tumble as market participants switched out of pounds 

 the pound also dropped <unk> against the mark falling below the key <unk> level to N marks from N marks late wednesday 

 mr. lawson 's resignation shocked many analysts despite the recent <unk> speculation of a <unk> between the chancellor and prime minister margaret thatcher 

 indeed only hours earlier mrs. thatcher had called mr. lawson 's economic policies sound and said she has always supported him 

 there was a general feeling that we 'd seen the worst said patrick foley deputy chief economic adviser for <unk> bank in london 

 the resignation came as a great surprise 

 graham <unk> manager of foreign-exchange operations at hong kong & shanghai banking corp. in new york added that mrs. thatcher 's comments reinforced the market 's growing confidence about sterling and compounded the unit 's later decline 

 the market was caught totally the wrong way 

 everyone was extremely long on sterling mr. <unk> said 

 in late new york trading yesterday the dollar was quoted at N marks up from N marks late wednesday and at N yen up from N yen late wednesday 

 sterling was quoted at $ N sharply down from $ N late wednesday 

 in tokyo friday the u.s. currency opened for trading at N yen up from thursday 's tokyo close of N yen 

 few analysts had much good to say about the pound 's near-term prospects despite the fact that most do n't anticipate a shift in mrs. thatcher 's economic policies 

 mr. foley of <unk> noted that mr. lawson 's replacement john major the british foreign minister will take time to establish his credibility and in the meantime sterling could trend downward in volatile trade 

 but mr. foley predicted few economic policy changes ahead commenting that mr. major shares a very similar view of the world with mr. lawson 

 bob <unk> chief economist at <unk> bank in new york also noted that the pound 's sharp decline is pegged more to uncertainty in the market than a vision of altered united kingdom economic policies 

 unless mr. lawson 's resignation leads to a change in british interest-rate policy mrs. thatcher 's administration firmly supports high interest rates to keep inflation in check or <unk> toward full <unk> in the european monetary system 's exchange-rate mechanism mr. lawson 's withdrawal will have little long-term impact on exchange rates mr. <unk> concluded 

 also announcing his resignation thursday was alan walters mrs. thatcher 's economic adviser and mr. lawson 's <unk> 

 the pound which had been trading at about $ N in new york prior to mr. lawson 's announcement sank more than two cents to $ N prompting the federal reserve bank to buy pounds for dollars 

 the fed 's move however only proved a <unk> to the pound 's slide and the fed intervened for a second time at around $ N according to new york traders 

 meanwhile dollar trading was relatively <unk> throughout the session according to dealers who noted that thursday 's release of the preliminary report on the u.s. third-quarter gross national product was something of a <unk> 

 u.s. gnp rose at an annual rate of N N in the third quarter 

 the implicit price deflator a measure of inflation was down to a N N annual rate of increase in the quarter from a N N rate of gain in the second quarter 

 in europe the dollar ended lower in <unk> trading 

 the market closed prior to mr. lawson 's announcement 

 on the commodity exchange in new york gold for current delivery rose $ N to $ N an ounce in heavy trading 

 the close was the highest since august N 

 estimated volume was five million ounces 

 in early trading in hong kong friday gold was quoted at $ N an ounce 

 the following issues were recently filed with the securities and exchange commission

 on an office wall of the senate intelligence committee hangs a quote from chairman david boren do n't hold your ticket <unk> the show 's over 

 he once used that line in a <unk> meeting on panama meaning do n't shrink from taking action against manuel noriega 

 so how did a good senator like this end up <unk> a policy that required the u.s. to warn mr. noriega of any coup plot against him 

 i agree it 's ridiculous says mr. boren and indeed by now ridiculous may be the only way to describe how the u.s. decides to take or rather not to take covert action 

 george bush disclosed the policy last week by reading it to gop senators perhaps as a way of shifting blame for the panama <unk> to congress 

 but the broader truth is more complicated and <unk> 

 the policy was contained in an exchange of letters last october between the senate intelligence committee and the cia and national security council 

 staff lawyers for both sides were busy agreeing with one another about what the u.s. could not do to oust the panamanian <unk> 

 they simply got carried away with <unk> what the executive order banning assassinations really meant 

 mr. boren himself did n't discover the <unk> <unk> until mr. bush told him privately at the white house last week 

 it 's ironic that david boren should be in the center of this <unk> 

 a former oklahoma governor he 's a <unk> <unk> of presidential powers in foreign policy 

 he 's a rare democratic <unk> 

 he 's the senator most like arthur <unk> the gop senator from michigan who worked to forge a bipartisan foreign policy in the <unk> 

 <unk> and <unk> are heroes of mine mr. boren says referring as well to sam <unk> the democratic house speaker who <unk> with president <unk> 

 they allowed this country to be credible 

 i really want to see that happen again 

 if this were N mr. boren might even succeed 

 but in N most senators have other ideas 

 last july his committee rejected a reagan administration plan to support a coup in panama 

 ohio democrat howard <unk> refused to support any plan that might get people hurt a <unk> notion for a great power 

 maine republican william cohen said the plan might violate the assassination ban 

 so the administration dropped it 

 by october when the committee rejected a much more modest covert proposal even the administration was agreeing little should be done 

 mr. boren does n't think all this influenced the failed coup this month but he does concede that congress has made mistakes 

 in the aftermath of vietnam in the aftermath of iran-contra i can understand some people might think that if they plan a coup they have to bring their lawyers he says 

 but even mr. boren <unk> congressional oversight 

 writing in the harvard international review he says that his committee approves covert operations only when there 's a consensus 

 so what does consensus mean 

 it does n't mean <unk> he insists though he implies it means a bipartisan majority 

 the <unk> of u.s. foreign policy is essential he explains 

 why was <unk> so successful 

 because it had bipartisan support 

 mr. boren is confusing consensus on general principles with agreement on specific actions 

 elliott abrams a veteran of intelligence committee debates doubts that even <unk> or the <unk> <unk> would have taken place if consensus had been required 

 <unk> and <unk> were <unk> enough to leave specific operations to presidents modern senators mr. boren notwithstanding are less modest 

 the result is that the senate committee has what amounts to veto power over every covert action 

 i would n't say it 's quite a veto mr. boren <unk> 

 but would n't a president who acted despite senate objections be taking grave political risks 

 he would agrees the chairman 

 but that is something the president ought to know before he goes ahead 

 mr. boren even <unk> a silver <unk> 

 he figures the episode will help clarify any <unk> between the committee and administration 

 he points to a letter on his desk his second in a week from president bush saying that they do n't disagree 

 more broadly mr. boren hopes that panama will shock washington out of its fear of using military power 

 maybe this will jolt us out of the <unk> syndrome that we never are prepared to use force he says 

 maybe if every senator shared the principles of mr. boren 

 but it 's just as <unk> to argue that if even david boren can get mired in this sort of mess the problem goes beyond legal interpretation 

 maybe the problem is a political system that wo n't act without an exchange of letters that insists on running foreign policy by committee that <unk> a president as just another guy at the table 

 the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> is that we ca n't abolish these oversight committees because we 've seen too many abuses of executive power 

 but panama illustrates that their substitute is a system that produces an absurd gridlock 

 the lawyers are now in charge of our national security 

 in panama the u.s. interests at stake were <unk> minor the only people killed were foreigners <unk> enough to trust american will 

 americans may not be so lucky the next time 

 i was impressed by the <unk> of your sept. N story rural enterprise tough row to <unk> 

 we lived in rural areas many years but now live in st. louis county <unk> 

 this morning as i drove the N miles to my law office and <unk> the routine heavy traffic during that <unk> <unk> i thought of how <unk> it was that we made the decision to be residents of an expanding community with so many opportunities and where so much is happening 

 the presence of so many people cars and competing businesses is evidence of a healthy economy in a place where people want to live 

 i thought back to our time in small <unk> <unk> communities 

 i remembered how hard it was for an outsider to become accepted by <unk> <unk> residents and what <unk> <unk> an original <unk> in <unk> that were long accustomed to <unk> safe ways of thought and action 

 i remembered being fired at age N with five children at home when my views and actions were deemed <unk> by a <unk> small-town employer 

 how difficult it is for a thinking person to live among <unk> rooted in the past 

 now i <unk> in the freedom culture activity and diversity of this great metropolitan area with its traffic <unk> and perpetual <unk> projects 

 yet when my youngest child died two years ago i buried him in the church cemetery of a small missouri town 

 so after all even the <unk> critic of rural exclusivity harbors a continuing <unk> for those scarce rural <unk> thought to exist amid fields <unk> and country <unk>

 finnish government officials are negotiating with creditors of waertsilae marine oy a major shipyard that filed for bankruptcy protection this week amid confusion and mounting doubts that collapse of the nation 's entire shipbuilding industry can be <unk> 

 at stake are almost N jobs in an industry that has been the mainstay of finland 's <unk> economic revival 

 shipbuilding became a point of pride as finnish <unk> remained profitable long after rivals collapsed all over europe 

 but if as many now fear waertsilae marine joins the ranks of failed <unk> it might turn out to be remembered most as a <unk> on finland 's international reputation 

 the shipyard 's N billion finnish <unk> $ N billion backlog includes about N ships ordered by big international shippers including three for carnival cruise lines inc 

 miami-based carnival said the first of the three ships is scheduled to be delivered next month just in time for the winter tourist season in the caribbean 

 the second ship is scheduled to be delivered in fall N and the third in fall N 

 one analyst said the first ship probably will be delivered close to schedule but that carnival may have to pay up to N N more to get the second and third ships 

 all the ships are covered by loan guarantees from a state export financing agency even though it 's not clear whether they will actually be built 

 bankers worry that if the government makes good a threat to withdraw its guarantee commitments shippers will counter with a <unk> of lawsuits 

 state loan guarantees are rarely a source of controversy 

 however some bankers cited possible parallels between the waertsilae marine case and the collapse of norway 's state-owned <unk> <unk> as two years ago 

 in that case international banks and investors incurred big losses because they incorrectly believed the company 's debt carried implicit state guarantees 

 doubts about the quality of state credit guarantees could reduce the competitive strength of finnish companies in world markets where financing often is the key to winning orders analysts warn 

 moreover state-owned finnish companies lacking formal state guarantees could face greater difficulty raising funds in international financial markets bankers say 

 the decision by a majority of <unk> waertsilae marine directors monday to file for bankruptcy was an abrupt <unk> from previous government policy 

 in august the government played a major part in a sweeping restructuring of the troubled shipyard 

 at the time <unk> by oy waertsilae a conglomerate the shipbuilding unit faced potential losses estimated at one billion <unk> and was on the brink of liquidation 

 under the rescue plan waertsilae sold N N of its stake to a group of banks and pension funds 

 the government in turn guaranteed financing to complete the order backlog and took control of the board 

 government officials were expected to combine waertsilae marine with two other struggling firms and thus ensure finland 's survival as a shipbuilding nation 

 the government spent most of last year attempting to carry out such a plan but was <unk> when the parent waertsilae concern pulled out at the last minute 

 after the restructuring of waertsilae marine and bolstered by state loan guarantees two big bank creditors union bank of finland and state-controlled <unk> resumed lending the shipyard working capital 

 but the bankers got cold feet recently as government officials complained they had been <unk> about the shipyard 's actual financial condition and hinted the credit guarantees might be withdrawn 

 people familiar with monday 's board meeting said it was the state 's refusal to <unk> <unk> the credit guarantees that led union bank and <unk> to halt lending to waertsilae marine 

 then in a <unk> <unk> <unk> directors voted to file for bankruptcy apparently under instructions from finland 's industry minister <unk> <unk> 

 analysts say mr. <unk> had grown increasingly worried about the state 's potential financial exposure as waertsilae marine 's losses <unk> to more than double the figure estimated in august 

 noting that sweden wound up <unk> state subsidies of about N billion swedish kronor $ N billion during the 1970s in a <unk> attempt to salvage its shipbuilding industry one analyst suggested that mr. <unk> may have decided to cut finland 's losses once and for all 

 senior ministry officials <unk> with creditors during the week in an attempt to agree on some form of restructuring that would keep waertsilae marine operating 

 the talks may drag on for weeks before any concrete result is announced people familiar with them said 

 one solution would be to sell the shipyard to an outsider 

 but there appear to be few if any suitors 

 indeed the potential losses make any rescue scheme unlikely unless the politicians once again change <unk> and agree to pick up the bill analysts said 

 meantime shippers with vessels on order from waertsilae marine will remain in limbo 

 turner broadcasting system inc. said it expects to report an extraordinary loss of about $ N million in the fourth quarter due to early retirement of debt 

 the cable <unk> said the loss will consist primarily of prepayment penalties and <unk> issue discount and costs related to its <unk> $ N billion refinancing of its long-term debt and some preferred stock in one of its subsidiaries 

 a turner spokesman would n't speculate on the extent of the charge 's effect on the quarter 's earnings but said the company continues to expect to report a net loss for N 

 the company said the repayment or redemption of the long-term debt and the outstanding class a cumulative <unk> preferred stock of cable news network was made possible by an offering of about $ N million of debentures and notes and $ N million in bank borrowings 

 the offering included $ N million of N N senior subordinated debentures due N and $ N million of zero coupon liquid yield option notes due N 

 the notes were priced to yield N N and are convertible into the company 's class b common stock at a price which represents a N N premium over the market price on oct. N N 

 in addition the company called its N N N senior subordinated notes due N with an <unk> principal amount of $ N million for redemption on dec. N 

 as a result of the refinancing the company said the interest on the debt will fall to slightly more than N N from slightly more than N N

 at the others there are going to be a lot of disappointments after all those promises and all that big money that 's been paid to people 

 it all adds up to a cold winter here 

 says allen d. wheat head of trading at bankers trust co. people are just plain scared 

 one person who is past worrying about london 's blues is christopher <unk> 

 last summer he <unk> his 10-year career as a london <unk> and headed for the <unk> 

 he did n't stop until he got to jackson hole <unk> 

 i 'm glad to be out said the <unk> mr. <unk> in a phone interview 

 the percentage of your day spent <unk> your <unk> got greater and the work day kept getting longer 

 what am i doing in jackson hole 

 not a great deal 

 my wife and i will stay through the skiing season or until the money runs out whichever comes first 

 but unlike london out here i 've never heard anybody blow a car horn in anger 

 <unk> australia ltd. under pressure from bank lenders has called in accounting firm peat <unk> <unk> to help oversee asset sales and restructure the resorts and media company 

 analysts said the move could <unk> even <unk> action by the banks 

 but any move by the banks to take over qintex australia 's management could threaten its ability to operate its national television network under australian broadcast license rules 

 that in turn could substantially reduce the value of the television assets 

 the appointment of peat <unk> which has a unit that specializes in advising troubled companies came about as a result of a round of meetings held by qintex australia chairman christopher skase with bank creditors 

 yesterday mr. skase said the company is <unk> and with the continued support of its bankers is able to meet its financial commitments 

 qintex australia is a unit of qintex ltd 

 the qintex group 's problems began in <unk> in march when mr. skase agreed to buy mgm\/ua communications co 

 but the transaction faltered in september when qintex australia was forced to increase its offer to us$ N billion following a <unk> from rupert murdoch the deal fell apart altogether earlier this month 

 qintex australia owes creditors around a$ N billion 

 last friday qintex entertainment inc. its <unk> u.s. tv production and distribution affiliate filed for chapter N protection 

 the government is <unk> its newest weapon against white-collar defendants the power to prevent them from paying their legal bills 

 and defense lawyers are warning that they wo n't stick around if they do n't get paid 

 the issue has come to a <unk> in newark n.j. where federal prosecutors have warned lawyers for eddie antar that if the founder and former chairman of crazy eddie inc. is indicted the government may move to seize the money that mr. antar is using to pay legal fees 

 the warning by the u.s. attorney 's office follows two decisions by the u.s. supreme court last june 

 in those cases the high court ruled that federal law gives prosecutors broad authority to seize assets of people accused of racketeering and drug-related crimes including fees paid to lawyers before an indictment 

 if the government succeeds in <unk> mr. antar 's assets he could be left without <unk> legal representation because his attorneys are likely to quit according to individuals familiar with the case 

 a seizure also would make the case the largest and one of the first in which lawyers ' fees have been confiscated in a prosecution unrelated to drugs 

 the people who suffer in the short run are defendants but the people who suffer in the long run are all of the people because there wo n't be a vigorous private bar to defend the bill of rights says gerald <unk> a criminal defense attorney who says he has turned down a number of cases to avoid possible fee seizures 

 mr. antar is being investigated by a federal grand jury in newark where prosecutors have told him that they may soon seek an indictment on racketeering and securities fraud charges 

 under the <unk> influenced and corrupt organizations law or rico the government has the authority to seek to freeze or seize a defendant 's assets before trial 

 according to individuals familiar with mr. antar 's case prosecutors issued their warning this week after one of mr. antar 's attorneys asked whether legal fees might be subject to seizure 

 in a letter prosecutors told mr. antar 's lawyers that because of the recent supreme court rulings they could expect that any fees collected from mr. antar may be seized 

 prosecutors have told mr. antar 's attorneys that they believe mr. antar 's allegedly <unk> gains are so great that any money he has used to pay attorneys <unk> from illegal activities 

 therefore they said the money can be taken from the lawyers even after they are paid 

 justin <unk> and jack <unk> attorneys for mr. antar both declined to comment on the matter 

 in newark u.s. attorney samuel a. <unk> said i do n't think there 's any legal reason to limit forfeiture of attorney 's fees to drug cases 

 mr. <unk> said his office just responded to an attorney 's question about whether we would go after attorney 's fees and that is different from actually doing it although we reserve that right 

 mr. antar was charged last month in a civil suit filed in federal court in newark by the securities and exchange commission 

 in that suit the sec accused mr. antar of engaging in a massive financial fraud to <unk> the earnings of crazy eddie edison n.j. over a three-year period 

 through his lawyers mr. antar has denied allegations in the sec suit and in civil suits previously filed by shareholders against mr. antar and others 

 the sec has alleged that mr. antar aimed to pump up the company 's stock price through false financial statements in order to sell his stake and reap huge profits 

 mr. antar the sec said made more than $ N million from the sale of his shares between N and N 

 the justice department has emphasized that the government 's <unk> power is to be used <unk> 

 according to department policy prosecutors must make a strong showing that lawyers ' fees came from assets tainted by illegal profits before any attempts at seizure are made 

 still criminal defense lawyers worry that defendants are being deprived of their sixth amendment right to counsel and a fair trial if the government can seize lawyers ' fees 

 they also worry that if the government applies <unk> laws broadly the best defense lawyers will be unwilling to take criminal cases unless they are assured of being paid 

 the stock market correction of oct. N N was a grim reminder of the oct. N N market collapse 

 since like earthquakes stock market <unk> will always be with us it is prudent to take all possible <unk> against another such market collapse 

 in general markets function well and adjust smoothly to changing economic and financial circumstances 

 but there are times when they seize up and <unk> sellers can not find buyers 

 that 's just what happened in the october N crash 

 as the market tumbled <unk> market conditions prevailed the margins between buying bids and selling bids widened trading in many stocks was suspended orders took <unk> long to be executed and many specialists stopped trading altogether 

 these failures in turn contributed to the fall in the market averages uncertainty <unk> an extra risk premium and <unk> triggered additional selling pressures 

 the situation was like that of a <unk> who is thrown slightly off balance by an unexpected <unk> on the <unk> 

 his <unk> spread <unk> and <unk> apart just as <unk> spreads widen during a financial panic and soon he is out of control 

 unable to stop his accelerating <unk> he crashes 

 after the N crash and as a result of the recommendations of many studies circuit breakers were devised to allow market participants to <unk> and restore orderly market conditions 

 it 's doubtful though whether circuit breakers do any real good 

 in the additional time they provide even more order imbalances might pile up as would-be sellers finally get their broker on the phone 

 instead an appropriate institution should be charged with the job of preventing chaos in the market the federal reserve 

 the availability of timely assistance of a <unk> can help markets retain their resilience 

 the fed already buys and sells foreign exchange to prevent <unk> conditions in foreign-exchange markets 

 the fed has assumed a similar responsibility in the market for government securities 

 the stock market is the only major market without a <unk> of <unk> liquidity or a buyer of last resort 

 this does not mean that the federal reserve does not already play an important indirect role in the stock market 

 in N it pumped billions into the markets through open market operations and the discount window 

 it lent money to banks and encouraged them to make funds available to brokerage houses 

 they in turn lent money to their customers who were supposed to recognize the opportunity to make a profit in the turmoil and buy shares 

 the fed also has the power to set margin requirements 

 but would n't it be more efficient and effective to supply such support to the stock market directly 

 instead of flooding the entire economy with liquidity and thereby increasing the danger of inflation the fed could support the stock market directly by buying market averages in the futures market thus stabilizing the market as a whole 

 the stock market is certainly not too big for the fed to handle 

 the foreign-exchange and government securities markets are <unk> larger 

 daily trading volume in the new york foreign exchange market is $ N billion 

 the daily volume for treasury securities is about $ N billion 

 the combined value of daily equity trading on the new york exchange the american stock exchange and the nasdaq over-the-counter market ranges between $ N billion and $ N billion 

 the $ N billion the fed <unk> into the money markets after the N crash is more than enough to buy all the stocks traded on a typical day 

 more carefully targeted intervention might actually reduce the need for government action 

 and taking more direct action has the advantage of avoiding sharp increases in the money supply such as happened in october N 

 the fed 's stock market role ought not to be very ambitious 

 it should seek only to maintain the <unk> of markets not to <unk> up the dow jones or new york stock exchange averages at a particular level 

 the fed should guard against <unk> risk but not against the risks inherent in individual stocks 

 it would be inappropriate for the government or the central bank to buy or sell ibm or general motors shares 

 instead the fed could buy the broad market <unk> in the futures market 

 the increased demand would <unk> trading and stabilize prices 

 stabilizing the derivative markets would tend to stabilize the primary market 

 the fed would eliminate the cause of the potential panic rather than attempting to treat the <unk> the liquidity of the banks 

 <unk> market conditions could be observed quite frequently in foreign exchange markets in the 1960s and 1970s 

 but since the member countries of the international monetary fund agreed to the guidelines to floating in N such difficulties have been avoided 

 i can not recall any <unk> in currency markets since the N guidelines were adopted 

 thus the mere existence of a <unk> agency helps to avoid panic in <unk> 

 the old saying advises if it ai n't broke do n't fix it 

 but this could be a case where we all might go broke if it is n't fixed 

 mr. heller now at visa international was a governor of the federal reserve board from N until earlier this year 

 this is adapted from a speech to the commonwealth club in san francisco 

 bank of england governor robin <unk> urged banks to be cautious in financing leveraged buy-outs 

 caution should be the rule of the day said mr. <unk> in a speech to the association of corporate <unk> ' annual dinner 

 it would be damaging to industry and to the financial sector in general to say nothing of banks if <unk> does not guide the financing of leveraged transactions 

 his remarks were distributed to the press before chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson announced his resignation last evening 

 bank of england officials said the central bank had no comment on mr. lawson 's resignation 

 mr. <unk> reiterated that the exposure of united kingdom banks to leveraged deals have n't yet reached worrying levels 

 however in light of the risks involved in such transactions banks should satisfy themselves that they have the skills to participate in this market and clear policy guidelines on acceptable levels of exposure to such transactions he said 

 in other comments he said takeovers may not always be the most efficient way of <unk> a change of corporate direction or strategy 

 a similar result could sometimes be achieved at less cost by changing <unk> he said 

 intel corp. 's most powerful computer chip has flaws that could delay several computer makers ' marketing efforts but the bugs are n't expected to hurt intel and most computer makers 

 computer experts familiar with the flaws found in intel 's N chip say the defects do n't affect the average user and are likely to be cleared up before most computers using the chip as their brains appear on the market sometime next year 

 intel said that last week a customer discovered two flaws in its N microprocessor chip 's <unk> unit a set of circuits that do certain calculations 

 on friday intel began <unk> customers about the bugs which cause the chip to give wrong answers for some <unk> calculations 

 but while international business machines corp. and compaq computer corp. say the bugs will delay products most big computer makers said the flaws do n't affect them 

 bugs like this are just a normal part of product development said richard <unk> director of hewlett-packard co. 's advanced systems development 

 <unk> announced last week that it planned to ship a computer based on the N chip early next year 

 these bugs do n't affect our schedule at all he said 

 likewise <unk> research inc. and sun microsystems inc. said the bugs wo n't delay their development of <unk> machines 

 we have n't modified our schedules in any way said a sun spokesman 

 to switch to another vendor 's chips would definitely not be an option he said 

 nonetheless concern about the chip may have been responsible for a decline of N cents in intel 's stock to $ N a share yesterday in over-the-counter trading on volume of N shares and partly responsible for a drop in compaq 's stock in new york stock exchange composite trading on wednesday 

 yesterday compaq plunged further closing at $ N a share off $ N a share on volume of N shares 

 most of compaq 's decline is being attributed to a third-quarter earnings report that came in at the low end of analysts ' expectations 

 intel said it had corrected the problems and would start producing <unk> chips next week
