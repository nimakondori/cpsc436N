 we should not be seeing any more said bill rash intel 's director for the N chip 

 what 's more the bugs only emerge on <unk> applications such as <unk> design and scientific calculations he said and then very seldom 

 these <unk> do not affect business programs he said 

 the bugs will cause problems in specific and rare circumstances that will not occur in typical applications such as <unk> and <unk> said michael <unk> editor of the microprocessor report an industry newsletter 

 sun hewlett-packard and others say intel is n't wholly to blame for the <unk> 

 the real <unk> they said are computer makers such as ibm that have jumped the gun to unveil <unk> products 

 the reason this is getting so much <unk> is that some started shipping and announced early availability said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> 

 you can do that but you 're taking a risk 

 those companies are paying the price for taking the risk 

 in late september ibm began shipping a <unk> card that <unk> its <unk> model <unk> from a N machine to an N machine 

 an ibm spokeswoman said the company told customers monday about the bugs and temporarily stopped shipping the product 

 ibm has no plans to recall its <unk> cards the spokeswoman said and could probably <unk> the bugs without long product delays 

 we do n't look at this as a major problem for us she said 

 compaq which said it discovered the bugs still plans to announce new N products on nov. N 

 because of the <unk> however the company said it does n't know when its machine will be <unk> available 

 that 's a break from compaq tradition because the company does n't announce products until they 're actually at the dealers 

 the problem is being <unk> experts say because the N is intel 's future flagship 

 intel 's microprocessors are the chips of choice in many of today 's personal computers and the N microprocessor is the <unk> of the company 's bid to guard that spot in the next generation of machines 

 although these sorts of bugs are not at all uncommon the N is an extremely <unk> product said mr. <unk> the newsletter editor 

 intel 's N chip is the <unk> of intel 's microprocessors a <unk> <unk> chip that only the most <unk> computer users are likely to buy for at least several years 

 unveiled last april the chip <unk> N million <unk> on a <unk> of silicon more than four times as many as on intel 's earlier model N 

 intel <unk> the chip 's speed at N million instructions per second or mips 

 that 's four times as fast as the N 

 machines using the N are expected to challenge <unk> work stations and minicomputers in applications such as so-called <unk> which <unk> groups of computers together and in <unk> design 

 but while the chip 's speed in processing power is <unk> it 's real strength lies in its software <unk> 

 the N is the <unk> of a long series of intel chips that began <unk> the market ever since ibm picked the <unk> N chip for its first personal computer 

 a <unk> microprocessor processes N pieces of data at a time and is slower than newer <unk> chips 

 since then intel has <unk> a large part of the market with <unk> generations of <unk> and <unk> chips all of which can run software written for previous models 

 that 's what will keep computer makers coming in spite of the <unk> of bugs 

 big personal computer makers and many makers of engineering workstations are developing <unk> machines which are expected to reach the market early next year 

 of the big computer makers only apple computer co. bases its machines on motorola chips instead 

 the N is going to have a big impact on the industry said hewlett-packard 's mr. <unk> 

 it 's going to be the leading edge technology in personal computers for the next few years 

 this <unk> is not going to have any affect on that at all

 bethlehem steel corp. has agreed in principle to form a joint venture with the world 's second-largest steelmaker <unk> of france to modernize a portion of bethlehem 's ailing <unk> division 

 the venture which involves adding sophisticated equipment to make <unk> mill rolls is part of a <unk> effort to shore up a division that has posted continuing operating losses for several years 

 the other element includes consolidating <unk> 's <unk> operations 

 the entire division employs about N workers 

 while the joint venture affects only a small part of bethlehem 's operations it is significant because it marks the first time the nation 's no. N steelmaker has joined forces with a foreign partner 

 wall street analysts have criticized bethlehem for not following its major competitors in linking with a foreign company to share costs and provide technology to modernize old facilities or build new ones 

 we think it 's a step in the right direction for bethlehem said <unk> <unk> <unk> group 's international steel analyst 

 it 's important to share the risk and even more so when the market has already peaked 

 he said the move could be the beginning of a broader relationship between the two companies one that could open up new markets for bethlehem 

 bethlehem had little choice but to go with a european steelmaker because its competitors already have tapped the japanese and south korean industry leaders analysts noted 

 under terms of the agreement <unk> 's <unk> unit and bethlehem would establish a <unk> facility to make <unk> mill rolls at the company 's <unk> shop here 

 terms for the venture which would be jointly owned by both companies were n't disclosed 

 the <unk> unit has agreed to provide technology and expertise to install a so-called spin <unk> by early next fall 

 the <unk> improves the <unk> quality of the iron mill rolls which are basically huge rolling <unk> used to <unk> or shape steel products 

 bethlehem is also working with the united steelworkers union to consolidate <unk> 's two machine shops and four <unk> facilities of the <unk> operations 

 once the consolidation is complete bethlehem plans to concentrate its <unk> business on nuclear fabrication <unk> steel and <unk> steel rolls for rolling mills and selected <unk> applications 

 bethlehem said earlier this year that it planned to restructure the <unk> division to improve its cost structure 

 in the second quarter bethlehem posted a $ N million charge related to its plans to <unk> the division 

 if you 're still wondering about the causes of the slump in the junk-bond market consider the case of columbia savings & loan 

 the california thrift has just announced a $ N million third-quarter loss 

 how did this happen 

 well when congress in its recent s&l bailout mandated that the thrifts sell off all their junk-bond holdings by N it not only artificially increased the supply of these bonds in the market but also eliminated one of the few profitable investments thrifts have made 

 but there is a <unk> ironic twist to the columbia loss 

 as <unk> of the debate over a capital-gains tax cut know there is much talk in congress and indeed all over washington about the need to encourage long-term investment and discourage the financial sector 's presumed <unk> with the short term 

 now we regard this as a largely phony issue but the long term is nonetheless a big salon topic all around the <unk> 

 it turns out that columbia had this huge loss in large part because the new <unk> mandated rules forced it to adjust the book value of its <unk> junk bonds to the lower of either their cost or market value 

 they could no longer be classified as what columbia regarded them namely long-term investments 

 congress 's <unk> treatment of the existing structure of junk-bond holdings <unk> us of a story in the journal earlier this year about the baby bell companies ' desire to have the <unk> bans lifted on offering information services 

 the issue of seeking relief from congress was raised to <unk> <unk> the chairman of nynex 

 mr. <unk> replied legislation tends to be <unk> 

 i believe we have to take a shot at getting as much done as we can through the court through justice and through state and federal regulatory agencies 

 i see congress as a last resort 

 healthy thrifts such as columbia or the junk-bond market itself should have been so lucky 

 the reality of life in modern america is that if you want to <unk> something that works let it fall into the hands of congress 

 exxon corp. said it will move its headquarters from manhattan to dallas 

 most of the N employees at the oil company 's <unk> headquarters building including much of senior management were <unk> of the plan until informed at a morning meeting by chairman lawrence g. <unk> 

 the shift wo n't affect operations 

 as part of its restructuring several years ago exxon moved most of those out of the city and sold its <unk> rockefeller center <unk> to a japanese company 

 but the pullout is an embarrassment to new york city officials coming at a time of high office building vacancy rates and departures by other major companies 

 mobil corp. is in the process of <unk> its headquarters here and huge operations like j.c. penney & co. and trans world airlines have recently left 

 new york authorities informed yesterday about the move reacted with concern and even some anger to the idea of the nation 's third-largest corporation leaving without giving them an opportunity to accommodate it 

 we are <unk> but there 's nothing we can do about it now said stanley <unk> new york city deputy mayor for finance and economic development 

 meanwhile dallas welcomed the move 

 city officials there had been were aware that a large company was moving in but negotiations had all been conducted through a law firm and under the code name <unk> 

 when we were told it was exxon it was beyond all expectations what a coup said tom lewis senior vice president of dallas partnership the economic development affiliate of the city 's chamber of commerce 

 dallas its economy based on oil and real estate has been in a slump 

 exxon said it will build a new headquarters on a <unk> <unk> in the <unk> las <unk> complex in the suburb of irving 

 until the building is completed exxon will rent part of an existing office tower 

 las <unk> once a huge texas ranch is a <unk> complex of office buildings homes and recreational facilities that its developers have been struggling to <unk> in recent years 

 exxon officials said it will cost less to run its headquarters at las <unk> than in new york 

 the company wo n't say how much it will save but during at its interim location sources say it will likely pay rent of $ N to $ N per square foot 

 owners of the building in new york say they will be asking $ N per square foot for rent to fill the space that exxon is <unk> 

 in texas taxes and development costs are also lower they said 

 plus one exxon official said by eliminating the typically long new york <unk> between office and home management will expect employees to work N hours a week in dallas rather than a <unk> work week in new york 

 canadian production of market pulp rose N N in september from a year earlier as the industry operated at N N of capacity 

 the canadian pulp and paper association an industry group said canadian mills produced N metric tons of market pulp in september compared with N metric tons a year earlier 

 market pulp is wood pulp sold on the open market to producers of paper and other products 

 the statistics exclude pulp consumed at the producing mill or shipped to another mill that is affiliated with the producing mill

 in the first nine months of this year output was N metric tons down from N metric tons a year earlier 

 ima holdings corp. completed its $ N billion acquisition of american medical international inc. purchasing N million shares or N N of the los angeles-based health-care services concern for $ N a share 

 the price also includes assumption of about $ N billion in debt 

 ima is a group that includes first boston corp. and the <unk> family of chicago through the leveraged buy-out fund harry gray <unk> klein & partners 

 harry j. gray and <unk> n. klein along with five other ima <unk> were named to join american medical 's <unk> board 

 the completion of the merger agreement follows months of <unk> and turns 

 in january american medical brought in a new chief executive officer richard a. <unk> N who will remain as chairman president and chief executive 

 a few days later american medical announced sharply lower earnings taking charges of $ N million for insurance reserves and canceled real estate leases 

 in march american medical received a $ <unk> offer to take the company private from an investor group including large holder m. lee pearce 

 it also was considering a restructuring to help boost the stock price 

 a group including several members of the the bass family of texas urged the company to take some steps to maximize shareholder value 

 the following month the company put itself up for sale 

 it received more offers but the auction was surprisingly won by ima which bid $ N a share and asked mr. <unk> to stay on as an equity participant 

 he indicated that some assets might be sold off to service the debt 

 then after extending its offer four times waiting for a congressional tax ruling ima early this month lowered its offer to $ N a share amid turbulence in the junk bond market 

 american medical accepted the offer meanwhile indicating it had heard from two other suitors 

 but they never materialized and ima completed the purchase yesterday

 treasury secretary nicholas brady said that congress should grant the securities and exchange commission the power to close the stock markets in periods of crisis 

 in testimony to the senate securities subcommittee mr. brady disputed the view of sec chairman richard breeden who told a house panel wednesday that he does n't want the ability to halt the markets 

 mr. breeden contended that discretionary power could have an impact on the markets if rumors were to <unk> about when the exchanges might be closed 

 he added that the president already has the power to close the markets in an emergency 

 but mr. brady argued that the sec is closer to the markets and in a better position to understand when the exchanges are under such stress that they should be closed 

 separately mr. brady said he asked the working group on financial markets to determine whether futures margins are too low 

 he noted that some minimum margin requirements have been reduced to levels below those before the N crash 

 this raises questions whether futures and equity margin requirements are consistent at these levels and whether futures margins are adequate mr. brady said 

 margins are the amount of money an investor needs to put up to buy or sell a futures contract 

 margins on the futures exchanges typically are raised and lowered according to market volatility 

 the chicago mercantile exchange margins for the standard & poor 's N stock-index futures stood at $ N a contract for speculators and $ N for <unk> before oct. N N that day the hedging margin was raised to $ N 

 margins were raised or lowered about a dozen times since the crash oct. N N 

 currently they stand at $ N for speculators who are typically individuals and <unk> traders and $ N for <unk> which are usually institutions and have offsetting positions in the underlying stocks 

 mr. brady also said he expects the leveraged buy-out phenomenon to end under its own weight 

 asked whether there is anything congress should do to curb the lbo boom mr. brady responded i think the lbo phenomenon while it wo n't stop completely will be a thing of the past 

 before taking any action he advised the panel to see what the market has produced as a cure 

 mr. brady also agreed with senators ' concerns about recent stock-market volatility and said he <unk> that the gyrations are scaring investors from investing in stocks 

 but he added that individuals still are participating in the equity market indirectly through mutual funds and pension funds 

 the former wall street executive refused to offer an opinion on the controversy surrounding program trading which has recently become a larger part of the trading in the market and has been blamed for accelerating the drop two weeks ago 

 i do not have a view of whether we should do anything about program trading at this time he said 

 but mr. brady endorsed the <unk> bill that both houses of congress will try to push through this session 

 that bill proposed by the sec last year would require brokerage firms to disclose the financial positions of their holding companies mandate large traders ' reporting of program or block trades and improve clearing and settlement of trades between the futures and stock markets 

 the bill also would give the sec the power to close the markets a discretion that former sec chairman david <unk> wanted but mr. breeden does n't 

 mr. brady and senators agreed to have their staffs meet within the next week to start <unk> the bill 

 the senate agriculture committee is responding to trading abuses in the futures markets with a far-reaching bill that would become the futures trading practices act of N 

 the proposed legislation has a <unk> goal to assure the integrity of the u.s. futures markets 

 however as is common with sweeping legislation the proposal contains many provisions that could destroy important parts of the system it sets out to preserve 

 the complex bill introduced by sens. patrick <unk> d. <unk> richard <unk> r. ind. and bob <unk> d. neb. covers a wide range of provisions that would affect the funding and authority of the commodity futures trading commission and would <unk> change the way the industry is regulated 

 these include provisions relating to the technology and systems that must be employed by exchanges oversight and disciplinary procedures for exchange trading practices the relationship between commodity brokerage firms and floor traders and exchange <unk> 

 the bill also <unk> even minor rule <unk> to <unk> and provides for recovery of punitive damages in civil lawsuits and arbitration cases without any showing of willful misconduct 

 many aspects of the bill are <unk> providing appropriate public <unk> that can and should be instituted throughout the industry 

 indeed some of the bill 's requirements including broad representation on the exchanges ' boards of directors and strong measures to prevent conflicts of interest already have been put in place by the coffee sugar & cocoa exchange and other futures exchanges 

 other aspects of the bill however are either structured in ways that create unnecessary burdens for the industry or actually are harmful to the exchanges the industry and ultimately the general public 

 one of the most prominent features is the requirement that in three years all exchanges have in place a system that records all trades by a source independent of the executing broker 

 the new york futures exchanges have been working together to develop a trade recording system much like the one called for in the bill 

 we would be <unk> to have such a system in place today 

 but is it realistic for congress to mandate by a rigid deadline a system that has not yet been <unk> to <unk> studies 

 what if the system does n't work 

 what if the only system that does work is so expensive that at best only the largest exchanges can afford it 

 cost is a key consideration because of the global sweep of the financial markets 

 the u.s. futures exchanges compete world-wide as never before 

 today trading in almost any commodity can be diverted from u.s. markets with just a few strokes of a <unk> 

 all foreign markets are aggressively <unk> u.s. business 

 in fact several london markets already offer lower costs for trading in the same or very similar contracts 

 the u.s. exchanges need both market integrity and <unk> long-term growth depends on it 

 the senate bill contains many provisions that will increase the costs of trading 

 the most <unk> of these is the <unk> of service fees which will directly widen the cost spread between u.s. and foreign markets 

 other provisions have a more <unk> but nonetheless real and <unk> effect on the international position of u.s. exchanges 

 these include the extension of liability into areas beyond those established by judicial precedent and the expansion of liability to include punitive damages 

 in addition to increasing costs as a result of greater financial exposure for members these measures could have other far-reaching <unk> 

 one section of the bill would make all commodity brokerage firms and floor brokers liable for damages without willful misconduct 

 nowhere in the federal securities law is simple negligence or <unk> action a source of liability under similar circumstances 

 it is only logical to assume that the enactment of this provision will lead to increased litigation 

 in an already <unk> business commodity brokerage firms may well decide to eliminate the risk and expense of dealing with the retail public <unk> the private individual of access to the markets 

 another measure makes commodity brokerage firms liable for violations committed by independent floor brokers who execute trades for them 

 this <unk> concept would <unk> these firms to potentially <unk> punitive damages 

 faced with the virtually impossible task of <unk> the execution of each trade many commodity brokerage firms are likely to stop doing business with <unk> and instead hire their own <unk> floor brokers 

 this would force out of business many of the individuals and small firms that function as floor brokers 

 a consequence of their departure could be a serious <unk> of market liquidity 

 finally under the bill a number of legitimate longstanding business practices would be <unk> banned unless the cftc were to take specific and timely action to permit them to continue 

 in other words regulation will occur through <unk> and <unk> rather than through a normal <unk> procedure 

 the affected practices include the placing of oral orders which is the way most public customer orders are placed and trading between affiliated brokers even though in some cases trading with affiliates may be the only way to obtain the best execution for a client 

 also <unk> would be dual trading <unk> a broker trades for customers as well as his own account a practice that provides needed liquidity to the markets 

 all u.s. futures exchanges agree that these and other trading practices require proper regulation and supervision 

 nonetheless each has too much potential value to the system to be banned by legislative fiat before the cftc carefully considers all the consequences of a ban and what the regulatory alternatives are 

 the markets are complex as is the environment in which they function 

 when problems surface the temptation becomes strong to <unk> overhaul a market system that has served for more than N years 

 that temptation must be put aside to permit careful consideration of all the implications positive and negative of the proposed resolutions to those problems and to avoid creating a marketplace where no one trades 

 mr. <unk> is chairman of the coffee sugar & cocoa exchange in new york and director of commodity administration at shearson lehman hutton 

 initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted N for the week ended oct. N from N the previous week the labor department said 

 the number of people receiving state benefits in the week ended oct. N fell to a seasonally adjusted N or N N of those covered by unemployment insurance from N the previous week when the insured unemployment rate was N N 

 counting all state and federal benefit programs the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended oct. N fell to N from N a week earlier 

 these figures are n't seasonally adjusted 

 on the <unk> streets of <unk> mahfouz 's cairo life is nasty <unk> and <unk> entertaining 

 <unk> the <unk> <unk> the <unk> of <unk> <unk> and takes a cut of every cent they <unk> 

 <unk> <unk> <unk> is a card <unk> and <unk> dealer who has a simple <unk> i live in this world assuming that there is no <unk> god or police 

 for the killer and thief said <unk> fame flows from the barrel of a gun 

 one man said you act as a <unk> a <unk> tells him a diversion to relieve people 's <unk> 

 mr. mahfouz 's cairo also has <unk> <unk> and <unk> wives who look to god not crime for their <unk> 

 but it is his portrait of cairo <unk> of <unk> and <unk> <unk> of streets filled with dust <unk> <unk> and animal <unk> that made his reputation and won him the nobel prize in N 

 three novels the beginning and the end N pages $ N the thief and the dogs N pages $ N and <unk> song N pages $ N recently published by <unk> offer an <unk> sample of the <unk> mr. mahfouz 's talent 

 but they do show the range of a <unk> <unk> whose <unk> novels span five decades and include work of social <unk> protest and <unk> 

 they also chart the evolution of a city that has grown tenfold in the author 's lifetime from a colonial <unk> of <unk> <unk> to a third world <unk> <unk> on its own refuse 

 soon it 'll be so crowded a <unk> complains that people will start eating each other 

 the beginning and the end easily the best of the three belongs to mr. mahfouz 's realistic period and it is the one for which he is most <unk> 

 published in N it follows the decline of a cairo family with the <unk> sweep and rich detail that critics often compare to <unk> <unk> and <unk> 

 a minor bureaucrat dies suddenly <unk> his family to poverty and eventual <unk> 

 his daughter turns to <unk> then to peddling herself for a few <unk> 

 one son <unk> his own career so that his <unk> brother can succeed while another helps support the family with money <unk> from crime 

 the real tragedy though lies not in the family 's circumstances but in its concern for appearances 

 <unk> for the father is <unk> by the shame of <unk> him in a <unk> 's grave 

 the family moves to another house at night to <unk> <unk> <unk> from neighbors 

 and the successful son wishes his embarrassing <unk> dead 

 as a <unk> of middle-class <unk> the story is <unk> 

 but its <unk> <unk> of cairo life are vintage mahfouz 

 we see <unk> and hear <unk> filled with the <unk> of <unk> advertising their <unk> <unk> with <unk> language <unk> <unk> and the sound of people gathering <unk> in their <unk> and <unk> into the street 

 and we meet engaging <unk> such as <unk> the head <unk> for his <unk> fights his <unk> and his <unk> 

 god has not yet <unk> that i should have earnings he tells his worried mother 

 <unk> comes to a bad end but so does almost everyone else in the book 

 if the setting is exotic the <unk> is closer to <unk> 's <unk> <unk> than it is to <unk> nights 

 mr. mahfouz began writing when there was no <unk> tradition in <unk> and he <unk> his work on western <unk> 

 in one sense this limits him unlike a writer such as <unk> garcia <unk> who has a distinctive latin voice mr. mahfouz 's style offers little that can be labeled egyptian 

 but the <unk> of his style also makes his work accessible as the streets of cairo come alive for the western reader as <unk> as <unk> 's london or <unk> 's st. <unk> 

 the thief and the dogs written in N is a <unk> psychological drama <unk> of crime and punishment 

 its <unk> said <unk> is an egyptian <unk> who seeks <unk> in <unk> and killing 

 i am the hope and the dream the redemption of <unk> he says in one of many interior <unk> 

 later he recalls the words of his marxist <unk> the people theft the <unk> fire 

 said 's story reflects the <unk> of socialism under <unk> whose <unk> rule replaced the <unk> <unk> in N 

 by N mr. mahfouz 's <unk> had <unk> or become <unk> as it has in said 

 his <unk> dream of <unk> a life of badly aimed bullets by <unk> the real <unk> the rich dogs who <unk> on the poor leads only to the death of <unk> and eventually to his own 

 cairo 's <unk> <unk> also has gone gray 

 here the city is dark and <unk> with <unk> said has left his jail cell only to enter the larger prison of cairo society 

 while the theme is compelling the plot and characters are not 

 we never care about said or the <unk> he <unk> 

 the thief and the dogs is a <unk> work the first <unk> novel in <unk> but it is likely to <unk> western readers 

 the N novel <unk> song also is experimental and another badly aimed bullet 

 the story of a playwright 's stage debut <unk> in <unk> <unk> in the manner of <unk> 's the sound and the <unk> 

 but the device <unk> more than it <unk> 

 buried in the work is a <unk> on the <unk> of art and on the struggle for integrity in an unfair world 

 but again the themes get <unk> in mr. mahfouz 's <unk> <unk> 

 the <unk> of his later work reflects both an appetite for new <unk> and the hazards of art in the arab world 

 mr. mahfouz has been <unk> and <unk> for questioning <unk> and <unk> peace with israel 

 <unk> his message has helped him endure 

 art says the playwright in <unk> song is the <unk> for the action that an <unk> like me is unable to take 

 <unk> song gives <unk> of a cairo that has become so much <unk> since his youth when as he once said the poorest person was able to find his daily bread and without great difficulty 

 the clutter of the <unk> remains but its color has <unk> away and the will to overcome has been defeated 

 cars ca n't move because of <unk> <unk> 

 characters complain <unk> about food <unk> prices and corruption 

 and the <unk> <unk> <unk> is now a <unk> and <unk> man who <unk> only government ministers can afford it these days

 norwood partners limited partnership of boston said it may make a tender offer for some or all of phoenix technologies ltd. 's common shares 

 norwood <unk> phoenix a <unk> maker of software for personal computers has had substantial losses in the past two quarters 

 its stock which was as high as $ N a share has been trading under $ N a share recently 

 yesterday it closed at $ N a share up $ N in national over-the-counter trading 

 in a securities and exchange commission filing norwood said it 's part of a group that holds N phoenix technologies common shares or a N N stake 

 norwood has made no detailed plans but it has engaged in talks with other shareholders the filing said 

 phoenix declined to comment 

 norwood is controlled by daniel l. barnett and paul a. <unk> both officers of <unk> <unk> capital management inc. a small boston money management firm 

 also involved in the group is robert f. angelo formerly phoenix 's senior vice president field operations who left phoenix at the beginning of october 

 mr. angelo was described in the filing as a consultant to <unk> 

 weirton steel corp. said it reached a tentative agreement on a <unk> labor contract with the independent steelworkers union covering production and maintenance employees 

 the agreement subject to approval of union members would cover about N workers 

 the tentative agreement provides for wage increases of N cents an hour <unk> to sept. N N and for increases of N cents N cents and N cents an hour effective jan. N N N and N respectively 

 it also provides for benefit adjustments including a partial restoration of <unk> and holidays as well as <unk> changes to increase productivity 

 ground zero of the hud scandal is the secretary 's discretionary fund a <unk> pot used to fund projects that were n't approved through normal hud channels 

 jack kemp wants to abolish it 

 instead congress 's idea of reform is to increase this <unk> fund by $ N million 

 and transfer control of much of it to capitol hill 

 the hud scandals will simply continue but under new <unk> 

 after one of the most amazing debates we 've ever seen on the cable channel <unk> the house voted N to N on wednesday to order $ N million in spending for a new jersey arts center a michigan library and N other pet projects out of the same discretionary fund that was supposed to have been so abused during sam <unk> 's tenure 

 hud has no paper work <unk> on N of the projects none of the others has been approved and not a single congressional hearing has been held on any of them 

 however four are in the michigan district of rep. bob <unk> the chairman of the house subcommittee that writes the hud spending bill 

 of course this kind of <unk> congressional <unk> is called <unk> service by members while the same kind of <unk> <unk> at hud is labeled influence peddling 

 unlike those awful republican consultants members do n't profit directly from hud projects 

 they merely collect campaign contributions from developers that help keep them in office 

 the N pet projects were discovered buried in the appropriations bill for hud and some other agencies after it returned from a conference committee that was called to resolve differences between the house and senate versions 

 conference committees are breeding grounds for <unk> 

 they are often closed to the public and no minutes are taken 

 members find it easy to doctor legislation by slipping in special provisions that could never survive in the cold light of day 

 in this case the members <unk> themselves 

 rep. <unk> recently purchased an <unk> building lot on the island 

 this is slightly adapted from remarks oct. N by former secretary of state george p. <unk> to an <unk> gathering at the stanford business school where he has returned to the faculty 

 i was struck a couple of years ago by the <unk> effort in the <unk> 

 we had <unk> during the year an estimated $ N billion street value of cocaine 

 i do n't know how much got through 

 nobody has any credible estimate 

 the gnp of the <unk> is probably somewhere between one and two billion dollars 

 so you get an idea of the leverage there and elsewhere that our market for drugs has brought about 

 i welcome the emphasis that is now being put on the drug problem 

 the efforts to get to the people who are <unk> try to <unk> them if they can not be <unk> at least to contain them to educate people to strongly discourage use of drugs by people who are casual users and first users to stop this process among the young all of these things i think are extremely important 

 but i have to tell you that it seems to me that the conceptual base of the current program is flawed and the program is not likely to work 

 the conceptual base a <unk> approach is the same that i have worked through before in the nixon administration when i was budget director and secretary of the treasury with jurisdiction over the customs 

 we designed a comprehensive program and we worked hard on it 

 in the reagan administration we designed a comprehensive program we worked very hard on it 

 our international efforts were far greater than ever before 

 you 're looking at a guy whose <unk> was attacked in <unk> by the drug <unk> so i 'm personally a veteran of this war 

 what we have before us now is essentially the same program but with more resources <unk> into all of the efforts to enforce and control 

 these efforts wind up creating a market where the price <unk> exceeds the cost 

 with these incentives demand creates its own supply and a criminal network along with it 

 it seems to me we 're not really going to get anywhere until we can take the <unk> out of the drug business and the incentives for <unk> out of it 

 frankly the only way i can think of to accomplish this is to make it possible for <unk> to buy drugs at some regulated place at a price that <unk> their cost 

 when you do that you wipe out the criminal incentives including i might say the incentive that the drug <unk> have to go around and get kids <unk> so that they create a market for themselves 

 they wo n't have that incentive because they wo n't have that market 

 so i think the conceptual base needs to be thought out in a different way 

 if i am catching your attention then read a bold and <unk> article in this september 's issue of science by <unk> <unk> on this subject 

 we need at least to consider and examine forms of controlled <unk> of drugs 

 i find it very difficult to say that 

 sometimes at a reception or <unk> party i advance these views and people head for somebody else 

 they do n't even want to talk to you 

 i know that i 'm shouting into the <unk> here as far as what we 're doing now 

 but i feel that if somebody does n't get up and start talking about this now the next time around when we have the next <unk> of these programs it will still be true that everyone is scared to talk about it 

 no politician wants to say what i just said not for a minute 

 the u.s. economy grew at a moderate N N annual rate in the third quarter the same pace as the second quarter despite the worst trade performance in six years the commerce department reported 

 personal spending buoyed by a burst of automobile buying was the main catalyst to the economy 's expansion 

 but trade one of the economy 's main forces in the past few years showed a sharp deterioration 

 imports of goods and services soared while exports were flat 

 some economists found the <unk> <unk> 

 for the past two years the foreign trade sector has been a major <unk> to economic growth 

 you ca n't rely now solely on consumer spending to sustain the economy on a solid growth path said norman robertson chief economist at mellon bank in pittsburgh 

 although the economy showed no change of pace from the second quarter many analysts expect it to slow considerably in the fourth quarter as demand for autos falls partly because of higher prices on models introduced last month 

 many economists think the rise in the value of the u.s. dollar this year will further <unk> progress in trade because it makes exports more expensive and imports cheaper 

 and business investment which slowed in the third quarter according to yesterday 's report is expected to continue to be sluggish 

 a sharp reduction in inflation was by far the <unk> spot in the report on the real gross national product the inflation-adjusted market value of all the goods and services the economy produced 

 an inflation gauge that measures the quarterly change in prices of an array of goods and services slowed its growth to a N N annual rate in the third quarter from N N in the second 

 much of the <unk> came from declining energy prices which have since turned up a bit analysts said 

 consequently michael <unk> undersecretary for economic affairs at the commerce department said inflation probably will edge up from the third-quarter rate in the final three months of N 

 but he said he believes the second quarter 's N N rate will prove to have been this year 's peak quarterly inflation rate 

 generally the bush administration expressed satisfaction with the economy 's progress as it heads into its eighth year of sustained growth next month 

 treasury secretary nicholas brady called the N N pace good solid growth although he said he expects the expansion to slow in the fourth quarter 

 he added inflation is lower than i think people expected it to be and i think that 's good news 

 but administration officials were concerned over the bleak trade report which showed the deficit in the country 's trade of goods and services swelling to a $ N billion annual rate in the third quarter from a $ N billion rate in the second quarter 

 mr. <unk> called it a disappointment but predicted exports will pick up again 

 we were <unk> for the deterioration in net exports said daniel van <unk> vice president of u.s. forecasting at bank of america in san francisco 

 i ca n't believe it will continue he added noting that the economies of the country 's major trading partners are strong and prices of u.s. products are still competitive 

 some analysts also were <unk> by a pickup in the growth of business inventories 

 while a buildup of these stocks adds to gnp it can hurt the economy because a <unk> of <unk> goods can lead to production cuts and layoffs 

 according to the report inventories outside the farm sector grew at an annual rate of $ N billion in the third quarter up from a $ N billion pace in the second quarter 

 manufacturers ' stocks <unk> at an $ N billion annual rate up from $ N billion 

 that suggests there is a little more inventory <unk> than some people expected said edward boss senior financial economist at continental bank in chicago 

 i do n't think it 's anything that 's going to cause a downturn in economic activity 

 but it will slow production 

 devastation from hurricane hugo which <unk> into the southeast coast in late september diminished personal income by about $ N billion the department said but it called the effect on the roughly $ N trillion economy negligible 

 except for the loss from the hurricane all the figures were adjusted for seasonal factors and inflation 

 here are some of the major components of the gross national product expressed in seasonally adjusted annual rates in billions of constant N dollars 

 in the third quarter the implicit price deflator fell to N N of the N average from N N in the previous quarter 

 northrop corp. received a $ N million contract by the u.s. air force for production <unk> and test equipment for the <unk> rainbow <unk> missile 

 the contract provides additional equipment for northrop the prime contractor on the missile and also supports a N purchase of N missiles for <unk> flight tests 

 general motors corp. 's chevrolet division said it is offering $ N cash incentives on all N models of its <unk> <unk> and suburban truck lines 

 chevrolet already has cash incentives on the N models of these vehicles 

 hudson 's bay co. announced terms of a previously proposed rights issue that is expected to raise about N million canadian dollars us$ N million net of expenses 

 proceeds of the offering will be used to redeem c$ N million of preferred shares and to reduce short-term debt the company said 

 canada 's largest department store operator said the rights offering will <unk> holders of its ordinary shares except residents in the u.s. and britain to subscribe for two additional shares for every five shares held at a price of c$ N a share 

 the record date is nov. N 

 the company has about N million ordinary shares outstanding 

 on the toronto stock exchange hudson 's bay shares closed at c$ N up N cents 

 hudson 's bay said that <unk> co. which currently holds about N N of the ordinary shares will subscribe for all the shares to which it is entitled and for any shares that are n't otherwise taken up 

 <unk> is a holding company owned by toronto 's thomson family 

 hudson 's bay said it will redeem N million series <unk> preferred shares on oct. N at a price of c$ N each 

 the move was approved at a special shareholders ' meeting yesterday 

 gary <unk> chief financial officer said redemption of the preferred shares originally issued at c$ N each will eliminate dividend payments of c$ N million annually 

 iverson technology corp. was one of the fastest-growing small companies in america until last year 

 the <unk> va. company <unk> computers to keep sensitive military data out of unfriendly hands 

 from N to N its earnings soared <unk> to $ N million on a <unk> increase in revenue to $ N million 

 but in N it ran into a <unk> saw a defense department spending freeze 

 iverson 's earnings plunged N N to $ N million 

 the troubles continued in this year 's first half when profit plunged N N to $ N 

 iverson technology is one of many small defense contractors besieged by the slowdown in defense spending 

 unlike larger contractors with a broad enough base to weather the downturn easily these companies are suffering big drops in business as <unk> specialty <unk> in the massive military market erode or even disappear 

 companies that only recently were thriving find themselves scrambling to survive 

 as their <unk> strategies suggest there is more than one way to respond to a disaster though it 's too soon to tell whether the changes will pay off 

 for many companies the <unk> first response is to cut costs 

 others are trying to find specialty defense work <unk> by the slowdown or new <unk> created by <unk> 

 more <unk> businesses are applying their skills in commercial fields 

 <unk> international inc. which provides professional and technical services to the military is refining its defense niche not retreating from it 

 after <unk> annual earnings over four years to $ N million in N the <unk> va. company posted a N N drop in earnings for this year 's first half 

 in the belief that development of advanced military technology will remain a top defense department priority <unk> last year acquired <unk> <unk> associates a technical and scientific analysis company with contracts under the strategic defense initiative 

 while the sdi <unk> program recently awarded <unk> <unk> two contracts totaling $ N million <unk> 's chairman and founder jack <unk> says he bought the company more for its technology than its customer 

 <unk> inc. an <unk> md. contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N has gone even further in <unk> its military business 

 as orders for its aircraft and <unk> parts <unk> three years of steady growth ended with a N N drop in income in this year 's first half 

 the company hit on a new strategy if the defense department is so intent on saving money why not make money off that trend 

 among the company 's current efforts <unk> old parts at N N of the cost of replacing them 

 <unk> also is selling new parts if needed directly to the military instead of through a prime contractor 

 at as little as one-third of the government 's cost the company is running a program to train army helicopter pilots 

 it is also taking over the maintenance of certain navy aircraft with N N fewer people than the military used 

 in another approach tiny iverson technology is trying to resume its growth by <unk> the new world of commercial products 

 donald iverson chairman says he hopes the company can eventually get up to half of its revenue from commercial markets 

 for now he says we 're looking at buying some small companies with niche markets in the personal-computer business 

 earlier this month mr. iverson agreed to buy exclusive rights to a software system developed by <unk> systems inc. salt lake city 

 the product <unk> an array of functions performed at small to <unk> printing companies 

 mr. iverson says there are N potential customers for the software in the washington d.c. area alone 

 <unk> inc. falls church va. also has acquired some companies outside the military market 

 moreover it 's trying to transfer its <unk> at designing military equipment to commercial ventures 

 a partnership with a <unk> va. unit of shell oil co. recently <unk> a process for producing plastic food containers that wo n't <unk> in microwave <unk> 

 we 're trying to take the <unk> and talent of our engineers and come up with new processes for industry says vincent <unk> <unk> 's chief executive 

 it is an effort to branch out from the government which is very difficult for a defense contractor 

 mr. <unk> should know 

 instead of helping his company in the defense spending slowdown dynamic engineering inc. a troubled subsidiary that makes wind <unk> for the space industry contributed to much of <unk> 's $ N million loss on $ N million in revenue last year 

 in january mr. <unk> sold the unit 

 it was our first acquisition he says and it was a mistake 

 some companies are cutting costs and hoping for the best 

 <unk> corp. a santa <unk> calif. provider of <unk> and <unk> services to the military enjoyed steady growth until this year 

 following a <unk> of earnings to $ N million on a doubling of revenue to $ N million over four years earnings in the company 's fiscal first quarter which ended june N plunged N N to $ N 

 a one-time write-off for <unk> <unk> revenue was partly to blame but so were lower profits from a <unk> contract with the army and delays in getting paid 

 <unk> responded by combining three of its five divisions to reduce expenses and bring more focus to potentially fewer bidding opportunities says lin <unk> <unk> chairman and controlling shareholder 

 it 's evident we 're entering a more competitive era he says 

 <unk> corp. a sherman <unk> calif. defense contractor that earned $ N million on revenue of $ N million in N provides a more dramatic example of cost-cutting 

 the company not only merged three <unk> manufacturing operations but also closed an unrelated plant that makes <unk> devices used in fighter planes and missiles 

 the closing contributed to a $ N million loss in the fiscal first quarter ended july N its first quarterly loss since N 

 our <unk> business has been hurt very badly by the slowdown says <unk> <unk> <unk> 's chairman 

 i would n't say we 're out of the business 

 but we 're not making as many <unk> devices as we used to 

 the growing crowd of japanese investors buying up foreign companies are n't all <unk> businessmen in dark suits 

 <unk> morishita whose art gallery last month became a major shareholder in christies international plc the london auction house is one man who does n't fit the <unk> 

 in japan he 's known in <unk> weekly magazines as the king of <unk> money 

 if nothing else the <unk> 's past has its share of <unk> 

 nearly N years ago mr. morishita founder and chairman of aichi corp. a finance company received a <unk> suspended sentence from a tokyo court for violating a <unk> law and an income tax law 

 he was convicted of charging interest rates much higher than what the law permitted and attempting to <unk> income taxes by using a double accounting system 

 he 's had other <unk> with the law 

 he was arrested though not indicted on at least three other occasions in the <unk> and <unk> for assault and unlawful <unk> for fraud and <unk> of private documents and for <unk> 

 christies says it has had no contact with mr. morishita since the stock purchase but that it 's happy to deal with him 

 we like to make our own judgments about mr. morishita says christopher <unk> christies ' group managing director 

 people have a different reputation country by country 

 mr. morishita is a leading figure among japan 's N <unk> which lend to small companies and <unk> which lend to individuals 

 many of these financiers lend freely often without demanding collateral 

 but the interest rates they charge are often near japan 's N N legal limit says <unk> <unk> a lawyer specializing in loan troubles 

 aichi is a <unk> mr. <unk> says and one of the nasty ones 

 in describing that business in general he says that when the client ca n't repay the loan some <unk> <unk> on like <unk> and even take over the client 's company 

 last month mr. morishita 's new gallery <unk> international ltd. purchased N N of christies for # N million $ N million 

 acquired from <unk> holdings u.k. ltd. a company owned by australian financier robert holmes a court the stake was apparently the first of its kind for <unk> an entity separate from aichi 

 and the acquisition which made <unk> one of christies ' top five shareholders left many people wondering who this man was and what his intentions were 

 we 're an investor mr. morishita says sitting back in his <unk> gallery filled with some N <unk> and <unk> 

 in the long run the stock prices will go up 

 it 's not clear whether <unk> plans to buy more shares 

 but christies mr. morishita insists is happy to see him become a long-term <unk> 

 mr. morishita considers himself a <unk> of art 

 in N years of collecting <unk> and japanese paintings he has acquired N items he says enough to persuade him to start a museum next year 

 he says he spent $ N million on his art business this year 

 a week ago his gallery racked up a $ N million <unk> at a sotheby 's auction in new york buying seven works including a <unk> 

 he makes <unk> judgments says <unk> <unk> the art gallery 's manager and mr. morishita 's secretary for more than seven years 

 mr. morishita 's main business certainly appears to be thriving although he wo n't disclose numbers 

 according to <unk> data bank ltd. which tracks company earnings aichi 's revenue rose N N to N billion yen $ N million in the year ended february 

 revenue doubled from two years ago 

 that is if the company reported results <unk> 

 the <unk> <unk> a japanese daily last month reported that aichi revised its tax calculations after being challenged for allegedly failing to report all of its income to tax authorities over a two-year period 

 the tokyo regional taxation office declines to comment and mr. <unk> the <unk> 's secretary says the problem simply resulted from a difference of opinion over what was considered income 

 the small <unk> mr. morishita comes across as an outspoken man of the world 

 stretching his arms in his <unk> white <unk> and <unk> his black shoes he <unk> a <unk> about the way to sell american real estate and boasts about his friendship with margaret thatcher 's son 

 but when asked what exactly he does in business he immediately takes <unk> 

 are you stupid he <unk> 

 you should know what questions to ask to get people to answer 

 not many people know the details of mr. morishita 's business but it 's a source of rumors about <unk> dealings 

 when a small company goes <unk> for instance the <unk> weekly magazines are often quick to link the demise with aichi 

 mr. morishita <unk> at those stories as well as the ones connecting him to the japanese <unk> 

 he says he has never even <unk> with <unk> 

 the seventh child of a store owner in aichi <unk> mr. morishita started out in the textile business 

 from there he set up his finance company and rapidly expanded from lending to investment in real estate to building golf courses 

 he spends most <unk> flying his helicopter to one of his nine courses he says two of which were designed by jack <unk> 

 he also owns courses in the u.s. and france 

 the <unk> financier recently started <unk> in <unk> circles 

 although he says he was n't keen on going last year he attended a new york <unk> where his daughter made her debut 

 he also leads an <unk> life style 

 even in <unk> one of tokyo 's <unk> neighborhoods mr. morishita 's <unk> brick <unk> one of some N houses he owns <unk> the neighbors ' 

 a <unk> white <unk> with a <unk> window towers over the brick wall surrounding his property 

 although mr. morishita says little about his business he offers one rule to success never gamble too far 

 i quit after one try whether i win or lose he says 

 i 'm done in two minutes 

 mr. morishita says he intends to expand his business to many other areas at home and abroad 

 he 'll be there wherever there 's money to be made <unk> mr. <unk> the secretary

 as expected first interstate bancorp reported a net loss of $ N million for its third quarter because of hemorrhaging at its first interstate bank of arizona unit 

 the los angeles-based bank holding company disclosed last friday that it had taken a huge $ N million provision for loan losses at the arizona bank the result of the state 's worsening real-estate market 

 in yesterday 's report first interstate said its bank in texas also reported a loss of $ N million for the quarter 

 but it said that its consumer banks in oregon california nevada and washington performed well during the quarter and that nonperforming assets at these banks declined by N N over the year-ago period 

 private-sector union contracts signed in the third quarter granted slightly lower wage increases than those signed in the second quarter but wage increases still are running above last year 's levels 

 the labor department said wage settlements in the third quarter called for average annual wage increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 

 the last time parties to these settlements negotiated wage increases mostly in N or N wages increased an average of N N a year over the life of the contracts 

 if this pattern continues the labor department said N will be the first year that the measure has shown an increase since N when the department started <unk> <unk> contracts with those that replaced them 

 this reflects the restoration of wage cuts in the steel and other industries as well as higher wages granted nurses who work in health-care facilities 

 settlements reached in the first nine months of N called for wage increases averaging N N in the first contract year and N N annually over the life of the contracts the department said 

 for all of N union contracts provided for N N wage increases in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 

 in the second quarter contracts called for increases of N N in the first year and N N over the life of the contracts 

 the figures exclude <unk> payments and cost-of-living adjustments so the actual wage increases may have been bigger 

 about N N of the workers covered by contracts signed in the first nine months of year get <unk> payments about N N are covered by cost-of-living <unk> 

 unions covered by one or other provisions generally settled for lower percentage wage increases 

 the labor department said wage increases in manufacturing industries continue to be smaller than those in other industries 

 for all six million workers under major collective bargaining agreements regardless of when they were signed wage increases in the first nine months of N averaged N N including cost-of-living adjustments 

 an enormous <unk> has succeeded where the government has failed he has made speaking filipino respectable 

 the N <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is a character who stars in the children 's television show batibot 

 he speaks only in filipino 

 batibot which started in N as a hybrid of the u.s. program <unk> street has developed into a <unk> philippine effort 

 radio programs and books have followed the daily television show 

 in the process batibot an <unk> filipino word meaning strong or <unk> has become a powerful advocate of the use of the filipino language 

 it <unk> on ordinary young <unk> that there 's nothing to feel <unk> about in using their own language says <unk> david a sociologist and host of a popular television talk show 

 when we started the program six years ago the use of filipino was deemed <unk> by the <unk> middle class says <unk> brown the program 's <unk> 

 now she says it 's no longer an issue 

 the success of batibot stands in marked contrast to many academic and government attempts to promote filipino as a national language 

 filipino once known as <unk> is <unk> <unk> the <unk> language spoken in a part of the country 's principal island of luzon 

 resistance to a national language comes primarily from members of the country 's elite who generally prefer english 

 but while <unk> <unk> are quick to cite the logic in using a language as widespread as english they are often slow to reveal that they are <unk> against filipino say advocates of the native language 

 for the middle and <unk> class filipino is <unk> says <unk> <unk> a <unk> professor at <unk> city 's university of the philippines 

 there 's also <unk> 

 other opponents of filipino come from <unk> regions 

 they argue that their own <unk> should have equal weight although recent surveys indicate that the majority of the country 's population understands filipino more than any other language 

 there are seven major <unk> and more than N <unk> in the country 

 what <unk> to speak is an emotional mine field in the philippines 

 it is entrenched in the country 's colonial bonds to the u.s. in philippine class structure in the regional <unk> of its people and in its island geography 

 as they did when the philippines was a colony of the u.s. teachers for the most part teach in english even though it is a foreign language for most philippine children 

 as a result they often speak one language at home another at school 

 mrs. brown calls the <unk> cultural <unk> to filipino a language <unk> 

 the issue has been <unk> for years 

 it does n't take much to <unk> an intense debate 

 when president <unk> aquino whose command of filipino is <unk> announced last year that the language would be used in official communications there was an <unk> from many legislators who continue to conduct debates mostly in english 

 but many proponents of filipino see resistance to the language finally crumbling 

 they believe the media including batibot have played a crucial role 

 according to chief <unk> <unk> <unk> batibot does n't set out to advance the cause of filipino 

 it 's not as if we 're teaching language per <unk> he says we 're just using it 

 these days batibot is produced in a converted <unk> on a <unk> budget of $ N a one-hour segment 

 it is shown <unk> on two of the country 's five networks 

 with an audience totaling more than N batibot consistently ranks in the country 's <unk> <unk> <unk> programs 

 but advertising revenue is inadequate 

 <unk> there are threats that the program will <unk> 

 batibot lacks the polish of <unk> street 

 sound stages echo 

 acting sometimes falls flat 

 there are only two large <unk> in the program <unk> <unk> and a <unk> named <unk> <unk> 

 but the production is the equal of any local program 

 and the show 's creativity makes up for any technological deficiencies 

 the program is n't afraid to tackle controversial topics such as nuclear weapons and the environment 

 not that the language war is won even on batibot 

 during one recent episode all the advertisements were in english 

 cms energy corp. said management would recommend to its board today that its common stock dividend be <unk> at a modest level later this year

 black & decker corp. said it agreed to sell its <unk> chemical <unk> unit to orkem s.a. a french chemical company for $ N million 

 <unk> is the first emhart corp. unit to be sold as part of the <unk> manufacturer 's effort to reduce debt and consolidate operations after it acquired emhart earlier this year 

 black & decker said it plans to put other emhart units on the block in the future with the goal of raising $ N billion in net proceeds 

 black & decker <unk> emhart from the takeover bid of <unk> limited partnership last march by agreeing to acquire the maker of door <unk> and <unk> tools for about $ N billion 

 the move significantly expanded black & decker 's product line but also significantly increased its debt load 

 the acquisition boosted black & decker 's ratio of debt to total capital to more than N N 

 company officials have said they plan to reduce that ratio to less than N N over the next N N years 

 earlier this year black & decker put three emhart businesses on the auction block the information and electronics segment the <unk> electrical assembly business and <unk> <unk> 

 the three units had combined N sales of about $ N million 

 the three units contributed about a third of emhart 's total sales 

 in addition black & decker had said it would sell two other undisclosed emhart operations if it received the right price 

 <unk> is one of the previously <unk> units and the first of the five to be sold 

 the company is still negotiating the sales of the other four units and expects to announce agreements by the end of the year 

 the five units generated sales of about $ N billion in N almost half of emhart 's $ N billion revenue 

 <unk> posted N sales of $ N million 

 our divestiture program is on schedule and we remain confident that we will achieve our stated goal of over $ N billion in net proceeds said <unk> d. <unk> black & decker 's president and chief executive officer in a statement 

 the sales are an attempt to <unk> investor concern about black & decker 's increased debt burden from the emhart purchase 

 the company 's stock plunged when it first announced that it planned to acquire emhart 

 the company maintains that it does n't expect emhart to contribute to earnings for about another N months 

 in composite trading on the new york stock exchange black & decker closed at $ N yesterday down N cents 

 the company did n't announce the sale until after the close of the market

 <unk> in the budget being <unk> by the house-senate conference committee is something that looks <unk> and <unk> like a duck 

 it 's a <unk> tax on mergers 

 congress has decided to raise $ N million by charging companies $ N for the honor of filing the required papers under the hart-scott-rodino law 

 ever since the bad days of big is bad antitrust enforcement this law has required that anyone proposing a merger must make a filing describing the effects on all relevant markets 

 the <unk> filing is then reviewed and any antitrust concerns usually met 

 typically <unk> is used now to give managers of target firms early news of a bid and a chance to use regulatory review as a delaying <unk> 

 the $ N tax would be a small cost in a multibillion-dollar deal but a serious drag on thousands of small friendly deals 

 one especially dangerous aspect to the new tax would be that the proceeds will be used to increase the budgets of the antitrust division at justice and the federal trade commission 

 this amounts to a <unk> for regulators the more <unk> the more they get to keep 

 also as former reagan antitrust chief charles rule has noted this would establish the precedent that the government may charge parties for the privilege of being sued regardless of whether the government <unk>

 michael <unk> N years old was named vice chairman for planning marketing and industry services a new post

 cie. de navigation mixte chairman marc fournier said his board unanimously rejected as too low the $ N billion bid by cie. financiere de paribas to bring its stake in navigation mixte to N N 

 at a news conference mr. fournier accused paribas of planning to pay for the takeover by selling parts of the company whose interests include insurance banking <unk> <unk> sugar and orange <unk> 

 the chairman said his board members including representatives of west german insurance giant allianz ag and french banks credit lyonnais and societe generale hold nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital 

 mr. fournier said that as navigation mixte chairman he is prohibited by takeover regulations from organizing his own defense or doing anything besides managing current company business 

 but sources said he will be urging his allies to boost their stakes in navigation mixte which is being traded in london and is to resume trading in paris tuesday 

 at the same time he is expected to seek legal and regulatory means of blocking or delaying paribas 's bid 

 for the moment the sources said he has decided against seeking a white knight or organizing a <unk> for paribas 

 mr. fournier said navigation mixte 's N unconsolidated or <unk> profit is likely to be N billion francs $ N million up from N million francs last year 

 that is due mostly to payments from allianz for most of the N N stake it has agreed to acquire in navigation mixte 's insurance business 

 mr. fournier said the <unk> gain would mean nearly twice as high a dividend this year as last 

 if holders avoid <unk> to paribas he added they can expect strong dividends again next year 

 analysts noted that over the past N years mr. fournier has built his company through <unk> stock-market activity and has <unk> off at least three takeover attempts 

 this time however some analysts think he could face a real battle 

 without some unexpected coup de theatre i do n't see what will block the paribas bid said <unk> de <unk> analyst at the brokerage <unk> & cie 

 mr. de <unk> said mr. fournier 's biggest hope was to somehow persuade regulatory authorities to block the bid 

 paribas still needs the <unk> from the commission des operations de <unk> a government regulatory agency but analysts said that is considered likely 

 mr. fournier also noted that navigation mixte joined paribas 's core of shareholders when paribas was <unk> in N and said it now holds just under N N of paribas 's shares 

 once he realized that paribas 's intentions were n't friendly he said but before the bid was launched he sought approval to boost his paribas stake above N N 

 the petition is still pending but mr. fournier <unk> the likelihood of his organizing a takeover bid of his own for the <unk> paribas 

 one big question now is the likely role of mr. fournier 's allies 

 mr. fournier said the large institutions that hold nearly N N of navigation mixte 's capital all strongly support him but some analysts said they are n't so sure 

 allianz for example has said in official comments so far that it will remain neutral 

 paribas is allianz 's lead french bank 

 paribas said monday that it intends to bid to boost its stake in navigation mixte to N N from the N N it already owns 

 the purchase of the additional N N stake is expected to cost more than N billion francs $ N billion 

 paribas says it will offer N francs $ N each for navigation mixte shares that enjoy full dividend rights and N francs each for a block of shares issued july N which will receive only partial dividends this year 

 alternatively it is to offer three paribas shares for one navigation mixte share 

 the paribas offer values navigation mixte at about N billion francs depending on how many of navigation mixte 's warrants are converted into shares during the takeover battle

 the N tax reform act has nearly eliminated the number of large profitable corporations that do n't pay federal income tax according to citizens for tax justice a nonprofit <unk> research and lobbying group 

 in a study of N of the nation 's <unk> companies the group found that only seven managed to avoid paying federal income taxes last year compared with N in N the last year the old tax rules were in effect and N in N when some of the new tax provisions went into effect

 the report released yesterday comes as congress is considering a number of special tax breaks only three years after the sweeping <unk> legislation abolished or curtailed many <unk> 

 in the corporate <unk> the N law abolished the <unk> credit scaled back use of an accounting method that allowed large contractors to defer taxes until a project was completed and strengthened the so-called alternative minimum tax a levy to ensure all <unk> businesses pay some federal tax 

 the combination of lower rates and fewer <unk> has meant that the so-called average effective tax rate the rate actually paid of the N corporations surveyed reached N N in N compared with N N in the years from N through N according to the study 

 in addition corporations are now <unk> a bigger share of the tax burden as the authors of the N law hoped 

 corporate taxes paid for almost N N of federal spending in N excluding social security compared with less than N N in the first half of the 1980s the study found 

 tax reform is working the study said 

 under the new <unk> law the days of widespread wholesale corporate tax <unk> have come to an end 

 still <unk> co. pinnacle west capital corp. <unk> corp. illinois power co. media general inc. santa fe southern pacific corp. and gulf states utilities co. did n't pay any federal income tax last year although they <unk> a total of $ N billion in profits the group said 

 in fact six of those companies received refunds which totaled $ N million 

 the lobbying group used publicly available information to calculate each company 's domestic profits and its federal income tax payments 

 this is the fifth year citizens for tax justice has released a study on corporate tax bills 

 earlier reports which revealed that as many as N companies were avoiding income tax legally have been credited with helping <unk> efforts to overhaul the tax code 

 but even though companies are paying more taxes many are still paying less than the statutory rate the report said 

 and N companies paid effective tax rates of below N N of their income 

 while the overall picture is very encouraging significant corporate tax <unk> continues the study said

 seven japanese department-store groups were approached by investment bankers representing bloomingdale 's chairman marvin traub and more than half are seeking additional information on the group bankers say 

 what mr. traub is hoping to put together investment bankers say is a management-led group to buy the new york department-store group that he heads from campeau 's federated department stores subsidiary 

 federated ran into a cash crunch after it was acquired last year by campeau which relied heavily on debt to finance the transaction

 the big three u.s. auto makers posted losses in their core north american automotive businesses for the third quarter and expectations of continued slow vehicle sales and price wars are casting a pall over the fourth period 

 the strongest sign of the big three 's woes came from ford motor co. which said it had a loss in its u.s. automotive business for the first time since N 

 ford predicted fourth-quarter net income will fall below the year-earlier level partly because of a likely $ N million charge from the sale of its steel operations 

 the bleak automotive results were offset by strong earnings from some <unk> operations 

 still the combined profit of ford chrysler corp. and general motors corp. fell N N to $ N billion from $ N billion a year earlier excluding a one-time gain of $ N million at chrysler from the sale of mitsubishi motors corp. stock 

 the last time all three companies reported north american automotive losses was in the recession year of N 

 yesterday 's announcements helped spark a midday wave of program selling in the stock market 

 gm 's common closed at $ N a share down N cents ford fell N cents to end at $ N and chrysler eased N cents to $ N all in new york stock exchange composite trading 

 the market 's <unk> reflects the gloomy outlook in detroit 

 as japanese auto makers gained market share the big three with gm in the lead slashed north american production and launched a retail discounting <unk> 

 the price war peaked in the third quarter as big three factory discounts climbed to more than $ N a vehicle according to industry officials 

 gm probably had the heaviest incentives said robert s. miller chrysler 's chief financial officer 

 we all did what we had to do to stay within sight of them 

 but the costly efforts did little to slow japanese market gains and domestic car sales have plunged N N since the big three ended many of their programs sept. N 

 gm ford and chrysler have already cut fourth-quarter u.s. output plans an estimated N N from N levels 

 if sales do n't pick up the cuts will go deeper and incentives will <unk> again 

 ford which has long <unk> of its ability to weather a downturn saw earnings take a beating 

 the no. N auto maker blamed incentive costs and reduced production both the result of a substantially weaker u.s. market for a N N drop in net to $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 

 nearly all the decline came in ford 's u.s. automotive operations 

 the dearborn mich. auto maker ran a loss of $ N million on <unk> and marketing cars in the u.s. a deterioration of $ N million in that line from the N quarter 

 ford managed to show a profit for the quarter primarily because of earnings from overseas auto operations and financial services 

 a year earlier ford reported record net of $ N million or $ N a share on revenue of $ N billion 

 in the latest nine months ford earned $ N billion or $ N a share compared with $ N billion or $ N a share 

 the u.s. automotive loss was a sharp reversal for a company that had <unk> off N consecutive quarters of improved earnings until the N second quarter 

 but david n. <unk> vice president finance insisted that cost-cutting and tight production capacity will make results better in this downturn than in prior <unk> when ford had net losses 

 still mr. <unk> said ford expects the u.s. economy to weaken through the end of N causing weaker sales and production 

 as a result fourth-quarter profit will come in below N results although the drop wo n't be as sharp as the N N third-quarter decline he said 

 part of the drop will come from an anticipated charge of as much as $ N million from the proposed sale of its rouge steel unit 

 in the N fourth quarter ford had net of $ N billion or $ N a share 

 chrysler 's operating profit fell to a <unk> $ N million or N cents a share its lowest quarterly total in seven years 

 its $ N million or $ N a share gain from the sale of N million mitsubishi shares made net $ N million or $ N a share 

 sales were flat at $ N billion 

 the results include record quarterly earnings of $ N million from chrysler financial corp 

 a year earlier chrysler 's net was $ N million or N cents a share 

 mr. miller said costs of incentives caused a moderate loss in the highland park mich. company 's north american car and truck business 

 he said the loss was n't that much different from ford 's $ N million loss on u.s. automotive operations but he declined to be specific 

 mr. miller said chrysler spent an average of $ N a vehicle on its incentive programs in the third quarter compared with about $ N a vehicle a year earlier a <unk> mark at the time 

 he said chrysler is no longer sure of its forecast for industry car and truck sales of N million in the N model year 

 consumers he said are <unk> at higher prices on N cars especially after seeing the <unk> prices on N models 

 in the nine months net was $ N billion or $ N a share including the gain from the mitsubishi stock sale compared with $ N million or $ N a share after a charge of $ N million or N cents a share for plant closings in the N period 

 sales rose N N to $ N billion from $ N billion 

 heavy losses in north american auto operations sent gm 's net tumbling to $ N million from a record $ N million 

 <unk> gm does n't issue separate quarterly earnings for the north american automotive business 

 but analysts estimated that gm had a loss of as much as $ N million on domestic vehicle operations 

 an N N drop in north american factory sales of cars and trucks cut into revenue and rebates to dealers and customers more than offset gains from price increases on N model vehicles delivered during the period a gm spokesman said 

 but gm 's results also illustrate the increasing diversity of its operations 

 in one breakdown gm attributed half of its net to its two big technology units electronic data systems corp. and gm hughes electronics corp 

 meanwhile gm said overseas auto operations are on track to exceed last year 's record full-year net of $ N billion 

 the diversified operations helped gm build its cash reserves exclusive of its financial subsidiary to $ N billion as of sept. N a N N increase from a year earlier 

 this cushion could come in handy if gm has to trim fourth-quarter north american production schedules more than the already scheduled N N 

 under the circumstances it wo n't be easy for gm to exceed its record N fourth-quarter net of $ N billion the spokesman acknowledged 

 that means it 's unlikely the company will <unk> last year 's $ N billion full-year profit even though net for the first nine months was up N N to $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion 

 it earned $ N billion on revenue of $ N billion in the N nine months 

 there are two versions of measure for measure on stage at the alley theater here 

 one is a strong vigorous portrayal of shakespeare 's play the other is director gregory boyd 's <unk> of <unk> <unk> rock <unk> on old vienna 

 measure for measure is one of shakespeare 's problem plays so named because it does not fit neatly into a category such as tragedy comedy or history 

 its <unk> and uneasy <unk> of the serious and the comic is no doubt one reason why it is very much in <unk> with directors just now 

 last season hartford stage director mark <unk> mounted a production at lincoln center and currently two other productions one just closed at the old globe in san diego and another now at the seattle rep <unk> with mr. boyd 's 

 in the play the duke of vienna <unk> over the <unk> of his subjects and turns over the rule of the city to the <unk> angelo hoping he can set things right 

 when angelo <unk> that the young man <unk> has made his <unk> pregnant before he could <unk> her angelo <unk> <unk> <unk> to death 

 when however <unk> 's sister <unk> a <unk> in a <unk> goes to angelo to plead her brother 's case the <unk> <unk> immediately falls in love with her and in a supreme act of <unk> demands that <unk> yield up her virtue to him in exchange for her brother 's life 

 meanwhile the duke who set the original scheme in motion appears on the scene <unk> as a <unk> and becomes involved in a series of <unk> that has everyone <unk> the worst possible outcome until the duke <unk> a last minute <unk> for all concerned 

 for the alley production scene designer peter david gould has arranged a stark but extremely effective set featuring a <unk> platform of <unk> boards that <unk> into the audience 

 when the action requires a prison cell consisting of an <unk> wire <unk> rolls forward on iron wheels on the platform 

 in the play 's major scenes mr. boyd demonstrates that he has a firm grasp of the <unk> dynamic 

 when <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> her brother <unk> <unk> <unk> in his cell explaining the price she has been asked to secure his freedom when <unk> and the <unk> duke philip <unk> <unk> to <unk> angelo and when <unk> <unk> jefferies a woman <unk> by angelo <unk> him with his past <unk> the performers bring the dramatic high points to life with intense energy and intelligence 

 at such moments mr. boyd makes it clear that he has the capacity to be a superior <unk> of shakespeare 

 when however he decides to be modern or more accurately when he decides to be trendy the results are far less satisfactory 

 mr. boyd is of the <unk> school that believes one must find modern parallels or <unk> to make shakespeare accessible to today 's audiences 

 it 's a valid approach but it puts a heavy burden on the director to show an uncommon degree of <unk> and taste 

 in his measure mr. boyd has <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of vienna whom angelo is supposed to bring under control by converting them into <unk> <unk> <unk> and heavy metal types with a strong emphasis on leather chains and <unk> <unk> 

 loud rock music <unk> all the scene changes even those in the <unk> 

 when <unk> is arrested he is brought on stage <unk> except for the <unk> on his <unk> and <unk> 

 when the <unk> <unk> jack <unk> visits the <unk> to inform <unk> of her brother 's fate <unk> not only <unk> the mother superior on her rear but brings along a <unk> companion <unk> <unk> not in shakespeare 's script to <unk> <unk> 

 meanwhile the <unk> <unk> <unk> allen <unk> dressed in black leather and a prominent <unk> <unk> in enough <unk> gestures and <unk> <unk> to launch a space probe 

 the problem here is not in the concept but in its lack of discrimination 

 the <unk> at one point for example of a list of <unk> <unk> <unk> ranging from jim bakker and <unk> helmsley to <unk> <unk> <unk> is a bid for a cheap <unk> <unk> of mr. boyd 's ability 

 despite the excesses however the <unk> for the production has many more <unk> than <unk> 

 what 's more it represents an important step for the alley theater 

 measure for measure is mr. boyd 's first <unk> <unk> as the theater 's new artistic director 

 he succeeded pat brown who was fired by the alley board N months ago 

 her dismissal angered many in the regional theater establishment and led peter <unk> head of theatre communications group to write an editorial in american theatre magazine <unk> the board 

 none of this backlash could change the fact that ms. brown 's regime was <unk> <unk> and <unk> 

 now the alley has moved ahead on both artistic and financial fronts 

 not only is mr. boyd giving the theater a new sense of <unk> and excitement on stage the balance sheet is the best the theater has had in N years 

 as opposed to the $ N million deficit of the N season the N year concluded with a $ N surplus and a $ N cash reserve 

 <unk> last season 's runaway hit steel <unk> helped a lot but so did cost cutting and other measures insisted on by the board 

 only time will tell if mr. boyd can restore to the alley the <unk> it received when its founder <unk> <unk> was at the <unk> of her powers 

 but it is clear he is going to give it a shot 

 democratic leaders have bottled up president bush 's capital-gains tax cut in the senate and may be able to prevent a vote on the issue indefinitely 

 senate majority leader george mitchell d. maine said he intends to use senate procedures to force advocates of the tax cut to come up with at least N votes before they can address the issue 

 and neither democrats nor republicans are predicting that the capital-gains forces can produce enough votes 

 the <unk> requirement will be there and they do n't have the N votes sen. mitchell said 

 they do n't have the votes to get it passed 

 sen. bob packwood r. ore. the leading republican <unk> of the tax cut did n't disagree 

 i 'm not sure what 's going to happen he said 

 previously he had said he would be able to find the <unk> N votes eventually 

 sen. packwood has offered his <unk> package as an amendment to a bill now pending in the senate that would <unk> aid to poland and hungary 

 democrats are holding up a vote on the amendment by threatening a <unk> or extended debate 

 for a <unk> vote to stop the <unk> republicans must <unk> at least N votes 

 yesterday sen. packwood acknowledged we do n't have the votes for <unk> today 

 the republicans show no sign of <unk> 

 gop leaders continued to press for a vote on the amendment to the eastern europe aid measure 

 and they threatened to try to <unk> any other revenue bill in the senate with the capital-gains provision 

 this is serious business we 're serious about a capital-gains reduction said kansas sen. robert dole the senate 's republican leader 

 the strategy is let 's vote 

 the republicans contend that they can <unk> a majority in the <unk> senate for a capital-gains tax cut 

 they accuse the democrats of unfairly using senate rules to <unk> a <unk> hurdle 

 democrats counter that the republicans have often used the same rules to suit their own ends 

 the two sides also traded accusations about the cost of the packwood plan 

 democrats asserted that the proposal which also would create a new type of individual retirement account was <unk> with budget <unk> that would lose billions of dollars in the long run 

 republicans <unk> that <unk> revenue estimates were <unk> 

 the packwood proposal would reduce the tax depending on how long an asset was held 

 it also would create a new ira that would shield from taxation the appreciation on investments made for a wide variety of purposes including retirement medical expenses <unk> purchases and tuition 

 a white house spokesman said president bush is generally supportive of the packwood plan 

 marsh & mclennan cos. said it agreed to acquire the rest of <unk> & <unk> a leading west german insurance brokerage firm in which it has held a N N stake for N years 

 the transaction for cash and stock would represent the biggest european takeover since N for new york-based marsh & mclennan the world 's largest insurance broker 

 it 's also the first major sign of the long-awaited consolidation in the european insurance industry as the european community commission moves toward a single market by N 

 <unk> barriers will start coming down within the insurance industry next summer when big industrial companies will be able to buy insurance from carriers in any other ec country for the first time 

 that 's why we have been working hard to develop a single more unified presence in europe said <unk> smith marsh & mclennan 's president at a london news conference yesterday 

 analysts speculated that marsh & mclennan would spend between N million marks $ N million and N million marks for the rest of <unk> & <unk> or roughly N to N times the private firm 's estimated earnings 

 this is paying a big price to maintain their <unk> as the world 's leading insurance broker said philip <unk> an analyst at <unk> & <unk> a u.k. brokerage firm 

 earlier this year new york life insurance co. agreed to acquire windsor group ltd. a first step toward establishing a presence in the european market ahead of N 

 but most u.s. insurers have n't rushed to change the way they do business in europe because they believe the european market will still be dominated by a handful of domestic companies 

 under the proposed combination marsh & mclennan would gain a majority stake in <unk> & <unk> that would increase over time to the rest of the remaining N N 

 the three managing general partners would receive a significant number of marsh & mclennan shares said <unk> l. <unk> a partner who would also join marsh & mclennan 's board

 yet his <unk> in the case also a former military officer by the name of oliver north has been <unk> and profitably <unk> his involvement in the affair 

 what accounts for the difference

 the canadian government with a view to becoming more politically active in latin america is expected to announce tomorrow its application to join the organization of american states a washington-based regional agency 

 the expected canadian move has been welcomed by the bush administration even though canada has opposed such u.s. actions as the trade <unk> against cuba the <unk> of <unk> and the military support for nicaragua 's contra guerrillas 

 latin american countries have long urged canada to join the oas in the hopes that it would be a <unk> to the u.s. which for many years <unk> to dominate the <unk> organization 

 even though the u.s. also has supported canadian membership it has n't been a washington priority 

 the fact that we might not side with the americans may be a reason why canada 's membership in the oas has n't been over the years an item high on the u.s. agenda said <unk> <unk> former canadian ambassador to the u.s. 

 the canadian application is expected to be announced in san jose costa rica by canadian prime minister brian <unk> who is attending a <unk> celebration of costa rican democracy 

 canada has a larger and more beneficial role to play in the <unk> mr. <unk> said recently 

 some canadian political <unk> have opposed canada 's joining what they see as a <unk> organization 

 canada could do plenty of things to get serious about latin america without running the risk of getting caught in the cross fire between the u.s. and latin american members of the oas said jeffrey simpson a columnist in toronto 's globe & mail newspaper 

 canada at times could be an <unk> oas partner for the u.s. if its united nations voting record is an indication

 robert h. knight 's oct. N editorial-page article <unk> violence in comedy movies hollywood you <unk> me is interesting but somewhat <unk> 

 as a fan of older movies from the 1920s on i do not find modern <unk> contain violence sex and <unk> language to any greater degree than other recent movies 

 older movies have plenty of violence though it is portrayed in keeping with the more restrictive social <unk> of the time 

 for example one of my favorite movies is the N british comedy kind hearts and <unk> in which the entire comedy is based on actor dennis price 's <unk> eight titled <unk> all played by <unk> guinness because they <unk> his mother and stand in the way of his acquiring the family title 

 similarly one of the most popular comedy <unk> of the 1930s and <unk> was the murder <unk> 

 the thin man series of movies as well as many others based their entire <unk> appeal on the star <unk> ' <unk> <unk> and <unk> as other characters in the movies were murdered 

 further i think mr. knight made a poor choice in picking a fish called <unk> as an example of the <unk> state of modern comedy movies 

 the specific scene he <unk> in which pet dogs are crushed is somewhat <unk> of the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> in the old warner <unk> road <unk> <unk> 

 there is no <unk> <unk> <unk> portrayal of the animal 's demise 

 keep in mind that this is the same movie in which a character is <unk> by a <unk> only to pop right back up and <unk> in the window of a boeing N from the outside as it takes off 

 i will be the first to agree that there is much to be found wrong with modern movie making 

 many modern <unk> seem to be <unk> of writing drama or anything else without <unk> <unk> 

 sex and violence are routinely included even when they are irrelevant to the script and high-tech special effects are continually <unk> for good plot and character development 

 in short we have a movie and television industry that is either <unk> or <unk> of making a movie unless it carries a <unk> or r rating 

 hence <unk> amounts of <unk> sex violence and <unk> language are included as a <unk> 

 however these <unk> are not the exclusive property of modern <unk> and i believe mr. knight <unk> when he attempts to link this modern phenomenon too closely to a single category of movie making

 western european leaders who favor <unk> economic and monetary union are adding a new argument to their <unk> the dizzying political changes under way in eastern europe 

 french president <unk> mitterrand european community commission president <unk> <unk> spanish prime minister <unk> gonzalez and others have begun linking the rapid changes in the east to the need to speed up changes in the west 

 they are stressing that the best way for the west to help the east is to move faster <unk> western european economic and monetary unity 

 this would make the <unk> system more attractive to eastern countries they argue and allow greater economic aid and technological know-how to flow from west to east 

 the only response to the challenge being presented to us by the east mr. mitterrand told the european parliament in <unk> yesterday is to reinforce and accelerate the union and <unk> of the european community 

 mr. mitterrand proposed that a conference be <unk> next fall to write a new treaty for the ec allowing a european central bank and that the treaty be ratified by N 

 mr. mitterrand also proposed a separate bank for europe that would channel development money to the east 

 one basis for linking change in the east and change in the west is the notion that <unk> N million eastern europeans with N million western europeans is primarily the task of europeans despite the u.s. 's obvious strategic and economic interest 

 says a european strategist the u.s. tends to look at eastern europe not including the soviet union as europe looks at latin america important but far away 

 but for us in western europe these are europeans next door 

 a <unk> europe implies big changes in 40-year-old military and economic policies 

 there is likely to be a natural division of labor says <unk> <unk> director of the international institute for strategic studies in london with the u.s. more engaged in strategic issues with the soviet union and western europe more involved with specific aid measures for the east 

 the <unk> at july 's economic summit of major industrialized nations of the ec commission as coordinator of western aid to poland and hungary was a first step 

 in part this division is <unk> by economics west germany is a net exporter of capital while the u.s. is n't 

 while american aid efforts have been limited by budget problems yesterday france announced a three-year four billion french franc $ N million aid plan for poland 

 despite sudden changes in the strategic equation some western european leaders especially british prime minister margaret thatcher remain skeptical about european political and economic unity and are unlikely to let <unk> concerns change their minds 

 but british analysts are beginning to link the issues 

 we need a western <unk> says john roper of the royal institute of international affairs in london referring to west germany 's longstanding policy of a diplomatic opening to the east 

 for poland and hungary we need to think about a <unk> economic approach that would force them to price things <unk> in return for removing all our tariff barriers 

 he notes that the marshall plan of u.s. aid to europe did n't just throw money at <unk> europe it also <unk> and opened up those markets 

 the french analysis goes further 

 most of the west 's leaders have finally concluded that we all want perestroika soviet leader mikhail gorbachev 's policy of economic restructuring to succeed says <unk> <unk> security adviser to mr. mitterrand 

 but they have n't yet drawn the operational policy conclusions 

 he adds that with communism <unk> and mr. gorbachev scrambling to <unk> the soviet economy our interest lies in a controlled <unk> a contained nuclear reaction so we need to help him and not just with words 

 managing change he adds will require a lot more aid and a prominent role for the ec especially in dealing with the question of german reunification 

 <unk> de <unk> director of the french <unk> for international relations in paris says it is n't clear what exactly west germany wants 

 any push for a gorbachev vision of a common european home <unk> the eventual <unk> of the ec a <unk> partnership and the withdrawal of u.s. forces would be a very very serious problem he says 

 he doubts a <unk> <unk> state will emerge that would dominate europe but warns of a risk of <unk> change in the heart of the european community from a germany that is too strong even if democratic 

 he adds we and the rest of the ec have to talk to the germans now frankly and raise these future risks with them 

 while many <unk> particularly french ones worry that <unk> and emotional reaction to the changes in the east might lead to dangerous pressures for a <unk> europe or the <unk> withdrawal of american troops mr. roper in london sees a more positive scenario 

 there seems to be a message from moscow there 's a deal on offer he says 

 they want <unk> we wo n't try to undermine or destroy the warsaw pact 

 in return the u.k. and france could keep their nuclear weapons 

 he adds once both sides feel comfortable it should be that much easier to make more progress toward the economic and social reforms that are now starting in the east

 we have always taken smaller accounts but now we are looking for smaller accounts that will grow mr. schwarz says 

 our bread and butter is still the $ N million to $ N million account he says 

 the new services allow u.s. trust to cater to the new wealth mr. schwarz says 

 quarterly net income this year has risen just over comparable periods in N when year-end net was below the N level 

 in this year 's third quarter for example net was $ N million or $ N a share compared with $ N million or $ N a share a year earlier 

 assets as of sept. N fell to $ N billion from about $ N billion

 sun microsystems inc. <unk> back to profitability after its first quarterly loss as a public firm said it earned $ N million or seven cents a share in the fiscal first quarter 

 sun a maker of computer workstations reported sales of $ N million for the quarter ended sept. N up N N from $ N million a year earlier 

 in the N period the company earned $ N million or N cents a share 

 sun 's results were slightly better than expectations 

 earlier this month the company said it expected to break even for the quarter on sales of $ N million 

 in a statement scott <unk> sun 's chief executive officer said the company 's performance was hampered by problems tied to the introduction of a major new family of computers in april 

 one of those new computers called <unk> N accounted for nearly half of the N systems sun shipped in the quarter he said 

 more than two-thirds of the systems shipped meanwhile were products introduced in april 

 but problems in manufacturing forecasting demand and getting the bugs out of a new management information system made it extremely difficult for sun to meet demand for its newest computers well into the summer 

 these problems also resulted in sun reporting a $ N million loss for its fourth quarter ended june N 

 mr. <unk> said the issues that hurt sun 's performance earlier this year are now largely behind the firm and he indicated that sun 's profitability should increase throughout the fiscal year 

 sun also reported a record backlog of orders 

 while this indicates continued strong demand for the company 's <unk> computers sun faces increasing competition from digital equipment corp. and hewlett-packard co 

 recently analysts have said sun also is vulnerable to competition from international business machines corp. which plans to introduce a group of workstations early next year and next inc

 a merchant bank and investment fund have agreed to <unk> a reorganization plan to bring sharon steel corp. out of chapter N proceedings and to acquire the company 's <unk> assets in a transaction valued at more than $ N million 

 castle <unk> inc. a new york merchant bank and quantum fund said they would acquire the assets for a combination of cash and the assumption of certain of sharon 's liabilities

 two old friends george bush and deng <unk> are trying to limit further damage to <unk> ties 

 but as congress prepares a fresh package of sanctions against beijing the <unk> relationship could get worse 

 the problem for congress will be to weigh what china is saying to its people against the more <unk> message it is delivering to the bush administration 

 in a move apparently aimed at heading off new punitive legislation mr. deng sent an indirect signal to washington via <unk> lee a columbia university <unk> who met mr. deng and other chinese leaders in beijing last month 

 when he met with mr. bush on his return mr. lee says he told the president that the chinese made statements to me that i regard as a first step toward reconciliation 

 the communication mr. lee brought represents the softer line the u.s. has been hoping to hear from chinese officials since the june N massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in beijing 

 the chinese leader mr. lee informed mr. bush expressed some regret for what had happened in beijing and conceded that china 's officials <unk> some responsibility 

 mr. lee says mr. deng told him we should not mind those who participated in demonstrations signed <unk> materials and went on <unk> strikes 

 mr. deng added says mr. lee that we really made mistakes 

 we must not <unk> our responsibility and we can not just blame the demonstrators 

 mr. lee also reported to the president that in a separate meeting communist party chief <unk> <unk> said the chinese leadership looked <unk> on the students who took part in the demonstrations 

 mr. <unk> also pledged that the chinese red cross would publish very soon a list of those killed 

 and he told the <unk> that china 's leaders were very much concerned about the deaths and had arranged aid for the victims ' families 

 i <unk> my conversations to the white house prof. lee says 

 but he adds i was not acting as a <unk> 

 he says that the chinese never asked him to convey their statements to president bush but that the white house <unk> invited him to do so 

 mr. lee concedes the statements made to him are far different from others being issued in china but attributes that to the fact that the situation in china is very complex 

 according to u.s. sources in beijing the administration hopes mr. deng 's fairly <unk> comments will <unk> congress to be cautious about further sanctions against beijing 

 the president does n't want to have legislative sanctions says a u.s. official 

 but he may not have a choice 

 given china 's <unk> statements to its own people mr. bush may be unable to prevent new sanctions 

 beijing officials have said they will step up the campaign of <unk> and <unk> against those who participated in the demonstrations 

 sentences have been stiff 

 a university student got eight years for participating in the rallies sources in beijing said while an <unk> worker got N years 

 nor has beijing hinted to its citizens that it will publish the <unk> of those killed 

 so far the victims are officially considered <unk> and their families receive no compensation 

 a man <unk> down by a <unk> bullet while cycling to work carries after his death the official <unk> of <unk> his wife says 

 what 's more much of china 's official rhetoric is hostile to the u.s. 

 china frequently <unk> the u.s. embassy for <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> a political dissident who took refuge there after the massacre 

 in the u.s. there are still people who want to crush china and interfere in our internal affairs <unk> <unk> china 's new ambassador to the u.s. said as he left for washington last week 

 the house and senate are to begin soon <unk> out an agreement for sanctions legislation 

 it will probably be attached to a state department authorization bill which mr. bush is n't expected to veto 

 a congressional <unk> involved in <unk> the sanctions says they are likely to mirror those mr. bush enacted shortly after the massacre 

 but as legislative action they would carry greater weight and would be more difficult to <unk> 

 measures already in effect that are expected to be made law include a ban on military sales and exchanges a suspension of most <unk> government contacts and a halt to u.s. trade <unk> programs such as the overseas private investment corp. and the trade development program 

 <unk> those sanctions could prompt chinese <unk> 

 if the two sides are n't careful <unk> ties could spin downward out of control says a u.s. official in beijing 

 bush and deng are hoping that <unk> heads prevail 

 the amount of blood surgical patients can <unk> and store before surgery can be increased by the new genetically engineered drug epo 

 epo or <unk> is a protein the human body makes to stimulate the growth of red blood cells 

 a genetically engineered version of the human protein developed by amgen corp. of thousand <unk> calif. recently has been marketed by the <unk> pharmaceuticals division of johnson & johnson 

 a competing version of epo is being developed by genetics institute inc. in cambridge mass 

 the drug is being used primarily to treat <unk> 

 a new experiment reported in this week 's new england journal of medicine involved giving <unk> of amgen 's epo to N patients who wanted to store units of their own blood 

 the patients began receiving epo <unk> about a month before their scheduled surgery 

 they then began donating blood twice a week receiving an epo injection each time 

 if tests indicated a low number of red cells blood was n't taken 

 the <unk> patients donated an average of N units of blood each compared with only N units donated by a similar group of surgical patients who received a <unk> injection 

 the volume of red cells donated by the <unk> patients was N N higher per <unk> the research team representing a number of hospitals and blood banks reported 

 during its centennial year the wall street journal will report events of the past century that stand as milestones of american business history 

 tax shelters called individual retirement accounts or iras were created without fanfare on sept. N N but grew beyond expectations as an <unk> to personal saving 

 that labor day in his first major act after succeeding the resigned richard nixon as president gerald r. ford signed the employee retirement income security act 

 pension reform was its main thrust 

 labor and business leaders quoted at the white house rose garden <unk> hailed its provisions for <unk> corporate pension benefits 

 iras were like <unk> there 

 the ira 's conception is <unk> 

 in N then treasury secretary george <unk> with the key support of sen. carl <unk> sought some form of <unk> for the uncovered 

 that year a <unk> group headed by william <unk> in the legislation and regulations division of the office of the chief counsel for the internal revenue service was assigned the task of designing a plan 

 they used the N <unk> plan a pension plan created by a new york congressman for the self-employed as a partial model 

 this team initially called its new model personal retirement account or <unk> 

 but it did n't <unk> 

 so they opted for ira naming it after ira cohen a brilliant irs <unk> who helped them 

 ira himself confirms this account 

 ira rules have been changed over the years 

 one in N raised to $ N a year from $ N the amount a person could put <unk> into the <unk> accounts and widened coverage to people under employer retirement plans 

 this caused an explosion of ira promotions by brokers banks mutual funds and others 

 but in N congress sharply reduced the number of people who could qualify for its benefits and ira <unk> slowed their <unk> growth 

 ira account assets have grown to about $ N billion from $ N billion last year and just $ N billion in N 

 the soviet state bank announced a N N devaluation of the ruble against the dollar for private transactions in an apparent attempt to curb the nation 's rapidly growing black market for hard currency 

 the measure which will take effect next wednesday will create a two-tier exchange rate 

 commercial transactions will continue to be based on the official rate of about N rubles to the dollar 

 but for soviet citizens who travel abroad for business or tourism the rate will jump to N rubles to the dollar 

 tass news agency said the devaluation also will apply to foreigners ' transactions 

 but it did n't elaborate and it remains unclear how far western tourists and foreigners living in moscow will be allowed to benefit from the sweeping rate cut 

 the current ruble rate has long been out of line with the black market 

 as soviet leader mikhail gorbachev has opened up the country to foreign trade the <unk> has become ever greater 

 western tourists in the soviet union who could exchange a dollar <unk> illegally for about four rubles a year ago are now being offered N rubles or more 

 even at such rates black <unk> have been able to make big profits because of the dire shortage of consumer goods here 

 they use dollars to buy western items such as video recorders and personal computers and then sell them at a huge <unk> 

 the going rate for a small personal computer that costs about $ N in the west is anywhere from N to N rubles 

 even a pack of N western cigarettes can fetch N rubles or more 

 with more than N billion rubles in savings accounts and little to spend them on soviet consumers <unk> at the <unk> <unk> prices for such goods but they buy them anyway 

 moscow has already <unk> admitted that the ruble is n't worth much announcing in august that it will pay soviet farmers in hard currency for grain and other produce that they grow in excess of <unk> quotas 

 the <unk> of the official rate should seem obvious to everyone the afternoon newspaper <unk> wrote in a brief commentary on the devaluation 

 the state bank 's move is part of a drive to iron out exchange-rate discrepancies as moscow moves toward making the ruble convertible a goal that soviet bankers and economists say is still far away 

 rumors of an impending devaluation have been circulating in moscow for weeks but the size of the cut took many western bankers by surprise 

 it 's much bigger than we expected said one german banker who asked not to be named 

 the next step which could have a larger effect on businesses will come early next month when the bank for foreign economic affairs is to hold its first auction of foreign currency 

 soviet companies <unk> western currencies to buy equipment and supplies abroad will be able to submit bids 

 plans for the auction which was supposed to take place last spring and become a regular event have been <unk> by a lack of hard currency 

 soviet firms that hold some are unwilling to part with it and joint ventures are n't yet allowed to participate 

 the kremlin also has been unwilling to provide hard currency for the auction using a lot of it instead to finance emergency imports of consumer goods 

 if foreign tourists and businesses could sell their currencies freely at the new better exchange rate that would enable the state bank to increase its dollar reserves and would <unk> up some of the excess rubles in the economy at the same time 

 but the amounts they exchange may be limited most soviet hotels for example demand payment in hard currency from western visitors 

 unless other rules are changed the devaluation could cause difficulties for the people it is primarily meant to help soviets who travel abroad 

 over the past three years thousands of people here have made use of <unk> travel restrictions to get their first taste of life abroad 

 but under current rules they are allowed to change just N rubles into dollars and other currencies for each trip 

 at the new rate that would give them about $ N to travel on 

 it is n't yet clear whether the <unk> limit will be lifted 

 if it is n't the black market for dollars probably will continue to <unk> 

 international business machines corp. made news this summer when it landed an unusual contract to manage all of eastman kodak co. 's <unk> needs 

 but the computer giant appears to have lost a second key contract with kodak to archrival digital equipment corp 

 kodak yesterday confirmed that it has entered negotiations with maynard <unk> digital to manage all of its voice and data communications needs 

 kodak based in rochester n.y. said ibm also had bid for the business 

 ibm is based in armonk n.y 

 the loss is a setback to ibm which pointed to the kodak contract as an example of its success in systems integration 

 that 's an emerging business in which computer makers or consultants provide <unk> communications and computing services to major corporations 

 a kodak spokesman declined to disclose the potential value of the contract which is still in negotiation 

 he said that american telephone & telegraph mci communications corp. rochester telephone corp. and ibm itself would likely be digital 's <unk> on the project 

 when we decided to look outside the company for critical <unk> and communications services we wanted to get the best vendor for that service said paul allen the spokesman 

 that 's why we went with ibm for data center management and now digital for voice and data telecommunications 

 this year is the <unk> anniversary of the federal reserve system and some members of congress think it 's time to take a fresh look at the nation 's central bank 

 after N years there may be a few things that are worth <unk> 

 the regional federal reserve bank <unk> for instance may be out of date 

 in earlier years it may have seemed reasonable to give richmond va. a bank and allow los angeles only a branch of the san francisco bank but times have changed 

 maybe the whole regional system is an <unk> the fed after all is a national central bank 

 some of the would-be reformers however want to restore an arrangement we once had or at least part of it 

 in the beginning the treasury secretary and the comptroller of the currency were both <unk> <unk> members of the federal reserve board 

 but in N when congress was trying to find someone or something to blame for the great depression it decided to drop both the secretary and the comptroller from the board 

 carter glass a former treasury secretary who was then back in congress probably influenced the decision 

 he said that when he was on the board he felt that he had a great deal of power and somehow he did n't think that was a good thing 

 times have changed 

 rep. <unk> <unk> d. <unk> has introduced a bill in congress <unk> by rep. lee hamilton d. ind. that would put the treasury secretary back on the board 

 there is doubt that the change would accomplish much but at least congress as in N would be doing something 

 so far no one has suggested putting the comptroller back on the board 

 nicholas brady the incumbent treasury secretary is of course aware of the proposal and he does n't like it much 

 mr. <unk> has changed tactics dropping the <unk> idea 

 that may have pleased the secretary but h. erich <unk> chief economist of the investment firm of <unk> <unk> & co. suggests that mr. brady may figure he already has all the power he needs 

 like most treasury secretaries mr. brady takes a keen interest in monetary matters of course 

 he was in fact taking an especially keen interest in board matters even before he went to the treasury 

 after the october N market crash mr. brady as a private citizen headed a presidential commission that tried to decide what went wrong and what should be done about it 

 one of the commission 's recommendations was that a single agency probably the federal reserve should coordinate regulation of all financial markets 

 this recommendation might have encouraged a <unk> bureaucrat to try to expand his power but so far federal reserve chairman alan greenspan has n't made a pitch for the job 

 the fed has plenty of responsibilities in times of market turmoil and in N and again in N it appears to have handled them well 

 mr. brady has said he thought government agencies in the latest market drop were better prepared to coordinate their actions but he has left no doubt that he still likes the ideas the commission advanced nearly two years ago 

 in recent weeks moreover mr. brady has joined other administration officials in trying to urge the fed toward lower interest rates 

 the urging <unk> has been <unk> 

 in an interview with the washington post in early october the secretary said the fed may be slightly more interested in curbing inflation than the administration is while the administration may put slightly more emphasis on spurring economic growth 

 at least some economists of course would argue that inflation deserves a lot of emphasis 

 earlier this month the st. louis fed held a conference to assess the system 's first N years 

 <unk> <unk> a <unk> university economist noted that the fed 's record included the longest most sustained <unk> inflation in our history dating from either N or N to N 

 the <unk> argument is an old one but mr. brady on the board or off is surely trying to influence fed policy 

 equally <unk> the treasury secretary has <unk> the administration effort to bring the u.s. dollar down by shopping <unk> for west german marks and japanese yen 

 the treasury can do something on its own but to have any hope of success it needs help from the fed 

 the central bank has been helping but apparently not especially <unk> 

 the fed has been <unk> in foreign currency markets all right but through august at least it appeared to be <unk> the intervention 

 in other words it was offsetting purchases of marks and yen by buying dollars in the domestic money market 

 now <unk> intervention may have some effect 

 when traders see the fed is in the exchange market it may make them <unk> a little carefully for fear of what the central bank may do 

 but it 's generally accepted that <unk> intervention has little or no lasting impact on currency values 

 after august the fed may have stopped <unk> but it 's hard to see much impact on the dollar 

 the dollar is still highly volatile 

 the fed has let interest rates slip slightly but whether the main reason was dollar intervention the gloomy reports on manufacturing employment or the friday N market drop only mr. greenspan and his associates know 

 earlier this year martin <unk> president of the national bureau of economic research argued <unk> that a government that wants steady stable exchange rates might try some steady stable economic policies 

 trying to manage exchange rates to some <unk> level he said would mean <unk> monetary and fiscal policies from their <unk> roles and thereby <unk> excessive inflation and unemployment and inadequate capital formation 

 the more we think about it the more we suspect mr. brady does indeed have enough power where he already is 

 this has been a week of stunning events behind what was once called the iron <unk> and interesting shifts in official american policy toward moscow 

 it has also been a week when <unk> washington has had a high old time <unk> over <unk> reagan 's multimillion-dollar <unk> in japan 

 the latter may seem oddly irrelevant if not downright <unk> given the big picture and the way we have handled it in the nation 's capital has done nothing to <unk> that impression 

 in fact however mr. reagan 's casual <unk> of the office he so recently held raises issues about which americans can actually do something 

 our ability to influence the outcome of events in eastern europe and the soviet union is far more marginal 

 those events continue to move at a rate and in a direction which leave informed commentary let alone policy far in their wake 

 earlier this week soviet foreign minister eduard a. shevardnadze confessed that the u.s.s.r. ignored universal human values by <unk> afghanistan and to put it <unk> engaged in a violation of the abm treaty by building its radar station at krasnoyarsk 

 hungary is no longer a socialist peoples republic the communist party no longer has automatic delegates in the u.s.s.r. 's congress of peoples deputies and egon krenz was not backed unanimously by his fellow party <unk> when he took over as east germany 's new maximum leader 

 all of that is just for <unk> or so the hundreds of thousands of eastern europeans in the streets seem to hope and are certainly demanding 

 of like though lesser note secretary of state james baker put the administration <unk> behind perestroika and glasnost and therefore behind mikhail gorbachev in a pair of carefully <unk> <unk> over the past week or so 

 and last but not least president george bush now views the changes in eastern europe as absolutely extraordinary and believes that mr. krenz ca n't turn the <unk> back in east germany because the change is too <unk> as he told the new york times 's <unk> apple jr 

 in other words after some highly visible <unk> and public airing of differences the administration has come down on the side of those who believe that what we are <unk> from berlin to <unk> is a good thing to be welcomed rather than a new thing to be feared or viewed with <unk> 

 all of this is what history will note assuming that events do n't make it seem a bad joke when the record of this time is put down 

 for journalists however who write what they <unk> view as history 's first draft this has also been a week to give a lot of space and time to ron and nancy 's sales appearance in japan on behalf of a communications giant and its controversial founder 

 it has been a <unk> transaction this <unk> away of the prestige of the republic 's highest office 

 the japanese <unk> has <unk> up at least $ N million the japanese government has put up just about as much or so it is reported and at least one estimate puts the total <unk> at $ N million 

 all of which has enabled those of us in washington who enjoy <unk> in such things to go into high public <unk> as mr. apple and i did the other night on abc 's <unk> 

 <unk> away we raised what i still think were all the right issues and landed more than one hard blow but at the end of the affair there was just the <unk> nagging worry that we had been aiming at the wrong target 

 as one of his defenders so <unk> put it president reagan was simply doing what he had always done before his election and some would say thereafter as well 

 he was performing for pay and why should anyone expect anything more 

 primarily because there 's more to the matter than ronald reagan 's personal values or lack of them 

 selling the presidency for a mess of <unk> is not so much a devaluation from the <unk> of public life today as it is a reflection of the <unk> of public standards 

 the theme song for the 1980s has been anything goes and it has been <unk> with <unk> from wall street to some of the highest <unk> of <unk> 

 there are those who say that this is nothing new that america has always suffered from a bad case of <unk> when it comes to the <unk> between what is <unk> and what is practiced 

 there is evidence to support that view 

 <unk> years ago william james wrote to <unk> wells the moral <unk> born of the exclusive <unk> of the <unk> <unk> success that with the <unk> cash interpretation put on the word success is our national disease 

 but if it was the national disease in N it is today the national <unk> 

 if there is no law against it do it 

 if the law leaves <unk> use them 

 if there is no moral prohibition that <unk> <unk> it full speed ahead 

 and if you are caught or if people complain simply argue that everyone does it or no one said i should n't and <unk> it out 

 as a last <unk> when all else has failed and you are <unk> <unk> for having disappointed those who trusted you but deny having actually done anything wrong 

 see for instance jim bakker 's remarks upon being sentenced to prison this tuesday for <unk> the <unk> 

 consider the troubling <unk> between mr. shevardnadze 's speech of <unk> this week and the <unk> defense of everyone concerned with the iran-contra affair 

 the soviet foreign minister publicly concedes that his government violated <unk> of behavior in afghanistan and just plain <unk> about the radar station 

 we have people in high place still lying through their teeth about iran-contra and that apparently is n't going to change 

 for that matter those long ago identified as <unk> are still given <unk> hearings in the press 

 that is the key to the current national disease 

 no one seems willing to hold anyone in public life to a standard higher than the <unk> construction of the law 

 the <unk> media <unk> hunt about some politician 's private <unk> notwithstanding the general <unk> is to offer a version of the old <unk> who am i to judge 

 thus no standards no judgment and no values 

 you are mad because he 's making so much money say president reagan 's defenders 

 no we ought to be mad because he has <unk> the office we gave him <unk> it in the service of private gain just as we ought to be mad that public officials lie through their teeth play <unk> games about their activities or to steal a phrase make public service a private trough 

 i 'm not going to be <unk> into <unk> to any of this president bush told mr. apple in this week 's interview 

 he was referring to the absolutely extraordinary events in eastern europe and it is a <unk> position 

 but there is no defense at all for the <unk> of the 1980s 

 we did n't <unk> into it we <unk> and slipped down the long <unk> and now we have as its <unk> symbol a former president <unk> for a foreign <unk> 

 or perhaps that is a <unk> symbol for the united states of N everything for sale nothing of real value 

 mr. carter is a political <unk> who heads a television production firm 

 cineplex odeon corp. directors said the company 's chairman and chief executive <unk> drabinsky is considering bidding N million canadian dollars us$ N million to acquire the company 

 the board said mr. drabinsky and vice chairman <unk> <unk> are negotiating financing before offering c$ N a share to acquire all of cineplex 's shares outstanding 

 the directors added that the two executives have n't reached a final decision to proceed with a bid and that until an offer is made the board will continue seeking higher offers from other bidders 

 the directors said if messrs. drabinsky and <unk> mail an offer to shareholders by nov. N it will reimburse them a maximum of c$ N million for expenses related to a bid 

 we consider that his bid is an acceptable bid said <unk> <unk> spokeswoman for the independent directors ' committee appointed last may to <unk> and review bids for the company in the wake of a dispute between mr. drabinsky and cineplex 's major shareholder mca inc 

 mca and cineplex 's other major shareholder <unk> financier charles bronfman and his associates have agreed to tender their holdings to an offer by mr. drabinsky unless a higher offer is made by another bidder 

 mca holds half of cineplex 's equity and N N of its voting rights through restricted voting shares while bronfman interests hold about N N of the company 's equity 

 ms. <unk> said the committee had received other bids 

 she declined to identify other bidders but said mr. drabinsky 's offer is all cash and it 's for all of the company 

 several cineplex analysts have speculated that outside bids received by the committee were either <unk> low or for only part of the company 

 all this has really established is that mca and the <unk> have agreed on a price at which they can be bought out said <unk> <unk> an analyst with <unk> <unk> in los angeles 

 if a bid <unk> at that price shareholders will have every reason to be glad but the question of financing still remains 

 last april mr. drabinsky and a group of financial backers planned to acquire up to N N of cineplex for c$ N a share from bronfman associates 

 mr. drabinsky who would have had the right to vote those shares for two years said the purchase subsequently rejected by regulators was aimed at consolidating his control of the company 

 mca strongly opposed the drabinsky group 's move 

 the directors did n't indicate the source of financing for mr. drabinsky 's new proposal but said mca and the bronfman associates agreed in principle to buy for $ N million and then lease back to cineplex its <unk> theater complex in universal city calif. if mr. drabinsky succeeds in an offer 

 this is being done at the suggestion of mr. drabinsky and to accommodate him to facilitate his financing arrangements ms. <unk> said 

 in addition the directors said if a bid by mr. drabinsky is successful cineplex expects rank <unk> plc to acquire the N N of cineplex 's film house unit it does n't own and provide mr. drabinsky with additional loan financing 

 michael <unk> rank 's chief executive said the british theater chain 's total involvement would n't exceed $ N million but declined to give a breakdown between the loan financing and the proposed film house purchase 

 cineplex shareholders responded <unk> to yesterday 's announcement 

 in trading on the new york stock exchange cineplex closed at $ N down N cents with more than a million shares changing hands 

 on the toronto stock exchange cineplex closed at c$ N off N canadian cents well below the c$ N level 

 where 's the bid asked pierre <unk> an analyst and broker with toronto securities dealer <unk> st. lawrence ltd 

 mr. <unk> said he does n't think messrs. drabinsky and <unk> are anywhere close to arranging financing and that investors will need a solid offer before the stock begins to rise again 

 mr. drabinsky could n't be reached for comment

 mr. <unk> who succeeds retiring richard c. <unk> will be responsible for gas supply regulatory affairs and marketing and transportation and exchange for <unk> eastern pipe line co. <unk> gas co. texas eastern transmission corp. and <unk> gas transmission co 

 all of the companies are units of <unk> eastern corp. which acquired texas eastern corp. earlier this year 

 <unk> coors co. said its coors brewing co. unit will test market a new line of bottled water in the west beginning early next year 

 the move which was expected marks the first time since prohibition that coors has sold a <unk> beverage and marks the company 's entry into a crowded but fast-growing market that generated about $ N billion in sales last year 

 coors is hoping to become one of the first companies to distribute bottled water nationwide 

 <unk> sold by <unk> group of america a unit of source <unk> s.a. of paris and <unk> sold by a u.s. unit bsn of france are distributed to urban areas nationally but are less available in rural communities 

 coors with its large <unk> network could <unk> more markets 

 the company said the water will be called coors rocky mountain <unk> water and will come from the same mountain spring as water used in coors beer 

 the company said it will sell the water plain and with <unk> and cherry <unk> and will package it in <unk> bottles and N ounce bottles as part of <unk> 

 the test markets though not specified will be in northern california arizona and colorado some of the hottest <unk> markets 

 some of america 's biggest trading partners gave a quick <unk> to a u.s. proposal to <unk> world trade and reduce <unk> subsidies 

 in geneva where world trade talks are being held under the general agreement on tariffs and trade or gatt the european community called the u.s. proposal a step <unk> 

 and japan 's minister of agriculture <unk> and <unk> told a committee of japan 's parliament that washington 's proposal was <unk> and that tokyo would continue to heavily subsidize its rice farmers 

 the u.s. in a far-reaching plan submitted to the geneva meeting tuesday proposed curbing price support subsidies within N years and eliminating export subsidies within five years 

 u.s. officials said the plan was flexible and was intended as a <unk> approach for gradually removing <unk> subsidies 

 but the ec reacted <unk> arguing that the proposal 's main aim is to destroy the common agricultural policy the ec 's $ N <unk> price support program 

 the american proposal is not an adequate basis for negotiation the ec said in a statement 

 ec officials say they are <unk> that the u.s. has set a specific timetable and is insisting on the elimination of export <unk> not just reduction 

 ec agriculture commissioner ray <unk> said the u.s. plan calls into question the agreement reached by world negotiators last april in geneva seeking substantial <unk> reductions in agricultural support and protection 

 u.s. deputy trade representative <unk> katz replied that the proposal was entirely consistent with the april accord 

 he said he was surprised by the ec 's reaction calling it <unk> even <unk> 

 the u.s. proposal also was criticized by <unk> developing countries who said that the u.s. made no special <unk> for poor nations 

 while many experts argue that <unk> nations would eventually become <unk> in a free-market system the poorest nations are likely to need help in the meantime 

 ambassador katz said the u.s. was open to discussing particular problems of developing countries 

 the u.s. administration said its plan would allow considerable flexibility in determining how and when the <unk> goals would be achieved 

 the u.s. argues that its plan would ease the transition to <unk> agriculture trade by converting certain <unk> barriers into tariffs that together with existing tariffs then would be phased out over N years 

 but the ec is strongly opposed to converting agricultural supports into tariffs 

 the new u.s. package also says countries could temporarily raise tariffs on certain products if they experience an unusually heavy volume of imports 

 it would establish procedures to prevent countries from using health and <unk> rules to <unk> trade <unk> 

 seeking to <unk> european concerns u.s. agriculture secretary <unk> <unk> said in washington that the new u.s. plan would n't put farmers out of business but would encourage them to grow what the markets desire instead of what the government wants 

 the ec with a population of N million has N million farmers while the u.s. with a population of about N million has only two million farmers 

 japan 's objections to the u.s. plan center around its desire to stay <unk> in rice a <unk> food even though foreign producers are far more efficient 

 bell atlantic corp. said it agreed definitively to acquire one of control data corp. 's <unk> businesses 

 terms of the accord were n't disclosed 

 control data 's <unk> maintenance unit services products primarily made by digital equipment corp. and international business machines corp 

 the unit has N customers and according to one analyst had N revenue of about $ N million 

 under the agreement which had been widely expected bell atlantic would be buying control data 's customer base and its approximately N u.s. maintenance facilities in about N cities 

 however control data would continue to provide maintenance services for customers of its <unk> product line 

 the unit represents a small portion of <unk> control data 's overall <unk> business which last year posted sales of about $ N million 

 earlier this year the company sold a similar unit in europe for about $ N million 

 lawrence perlman control data 's president and chief operating officer said the maintenance business no longer fits into the company 's strategy to be a data solutions company 

 thomas <unk> president of bell atlantic 's customer services division said the acquisition would give the company 's <unk> <unk> unit added expertise in the increasingly sophisticated workstation and high-end mainframe technologies 

 two recent decisions by federal courts cast judges in the odd role of telling authors how they should write history and <unk> 

 these decisions deserve more attention than they have received from scholars and from journalists as well 

 russell miller 's bare-faced messiah the true story of l. ron hubbard is a <unk> of the founder of the church of <unk> 

 mr. hubbard who died in N <unk> the <unk> on his <unk> to his church which licensed them to new era publications a <unk> corporation 

 in N new era sought a permanent injunction to restrain henry holt & co. from publishing bare-faced messiah on the ground that mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard infringed the <unk> 

 the publisher argued in response that the fair use statute permits <unk> for purposes such as criticism comment news reporting teaching <unk> or research 

 district court judge pierre leval denied the injunction on the ground that new era had failed to make its claim within a reasonable time the doctrine lawyers call <unk> 

 as for the merits judge leval said that mr. miller had written a serious book of responsible historical criticism 

 <unk> <unk> the judge believed was justified in order to prove points the author had asserted about mr. hubbard <unk> <unk> <unk> and other <unk> <unk> that could not be <unk> demonstrated without use of mr. hubbard 's own words 

 the <unk> judge leval wrote should not be required simply to express conclusions without defending them by example 

 in such circumstances <unk> interests <unk> the interests of the copyright owner 

 but judge leval felt <unk> by an earlier decision of the second circuit court <unk> a <unk> of <unk> salinger to quote from mr. salinger 's personal letters 

 he distinguished the two cases in salinger judge leval noted the quotations were for the purpose of <unk> the <unk> rather than of proving points about the subject 

 still the salinger decision created a strong <unk> against fair use of unpublished materials 

 judge leval <unk> concluded that a few of mr. miller 's quotations from mr. hubbard 's unpublished <unk> because they were not necessary to prove historical points failed the <unk> test and therefore infringed copyright 

 but the proper remedy judge leval said lay in a suit for damages not in an injunction 

 the case went on appeal to the second circuit 

 in a decision in april of this year judge roger <unk> joined by judge frank <unk> agreed on denying the injunction and did not doubt that bare-faced messiah was a serious work but rejected judge leval 's argument that the public interest in <unk> could outweigh the <unk> of copyright 

 we conclude the two judges wrote that <unk> is the sole bar to the issuance of an injunction 

 had the suit been filed in time they said bare-faced messiah would have been <unk> 

 this was too much for james oakes the court 's chief judge 

 in a powerful separate opinion judge oakes further distinguished the salinger case by pointing out that a living person like mr. salinger had privacy rights that did not apply to a dead man like mr. hubbard 

 i thought that salinger might by being taken in another <unk> context come back to <unk> us 

 this case <unk> that concern 

 decisions by the second circuit itself judge oakes continued had recognized that public interest in the subject matter and the <unk> in particular cases of <unk> quotations are vital components of fair use 

 and the injunction judges <unk> and <unk> would so readily have granted had new era sued in time 

 <unk> of the book judge oakes observed would operate as a prior restraint and thus involve the first amendment 

 moreover and here judge oakes went to the heart of the question responsible <unk> and <unk> constantly use primary sources letters <unk> and <unk> 

 indeed it would be irresponsible to ignore such sources of information 

 now scholars in <unk> their responsibility do not claim the right to <unk> every collection of papers that bears upon their topics of investigation 

 and of course they agree that people can impose restrictions on the use of their papers whether in their own <unk> or as donated or sold to <unk> 

 but in the bare-faced messiah case the author found most of his material in court records or via the freedom of information act 

 and when responsible scholars gain legitimate access to unpublished materials copyright should not be permitted to deny them use of quotations that help to establish historical points 

 judges oakes and leval understand the requirements of historical <unk> 

 judges <unk> and <unk> do not appear to have a clue 

 yet at the moment they are the judges who are making the law 

 as matters stand the salinger ruling torn from context and broadly <unk> is controlling 

 if an author quotes more than minimal amounts of unpublished <unk> materials as the salinger decision had it he deserves to be <unk> 

 the courts have not defined minimal amounts but publishers i understand take it to mean about N words 

 the bare-faced messiah decision strikes a blow against the whole historical enterprise 

 a second decision handed down in august by the court of appeals for the ninth circuit is another blow against <unk> 

 <unk> malcolm a professional writer on psychiatric matters wrote a series of articles for the new yorker later published in book form by <unk> under the title in the <unk> <unk> 

 the articles were largely based on interviews ms. malcolm had taped with jeffrey masson a <unk> who had served as projects director of the <unk> <unk> 

 mr. masson then brought a libel suit against ms. malcolm the new yorker and <unk> 

 as a public figure mr. masson had to prove <unk> and as proof of <unk> mr. masson contended that <unk> quotations <unk> to him by ms. malcolm were in fact <unk> 

 the quotes could not be found on the tapes and the two judges who decided the case for ms. malcolm and her publishers conceded that for the purpose of their decision we assume the quotations were deliberately altered 

 for all <unk> and most journalists this admission would have been sufficient to condemn the malcolm articles 

 but judge arthur <unk> joined by judge cynthia <unk> hall took the <unk> position that it is perfectly ok to <unk> quotations so long as a judge finds that the <unk> do not alter <unk> content or are rational <unk> of <unk> remarks 

 in his <unk> dissent judge alex <unk> observed that when a writer uses <unk> marks in reporting what someone has said the reader assumes that these are the speaker 's precise words or at least his words <unk> of <unk> and you know and <unk> error 

 while judges have an obligation under the first amendment to <unk> freedom of the press the right to deliberately alter quotations is not in my view a <unk> of a free press 

 ms. malcolm for example wrote that mr. masson described himself as the greatest analyst who ever lived 

 no such statement appears on the tapes 

 the majority cited mr. masson 's remark it 's me alone against the rest of the <unk> world as warrant for the malcolm fabrication 

 but as judge <unk> noted the context shows that mr. masson 's me alone remark referred not to his alleged <unk> in his profession but to the fact that his position on a particular issue was not shared by anyone else 

 ms. malcolm had mr. masson describing himself as an intellectual <unk> 

 again no such statement appears on the tapes 

 the majority decision contended that the phrase was a rational interpretation of mr. masson 's <unk> of himself as a private asset but a public liability to <unk> <unk> and that in any case it was not <unk> 

 judge <unk> found the <unk> entirely <unk> and writes that for an academic to refer to himself as an intellectual <unk> is a devastating admission of professional dishonesty 

 these were only two of a series of <unk> that had in judge <unk> 's words the cumulative effect of making mr. masson appear more arrogant less sensitive <unk> more <unk> and less in touch with reality than he appears from his own statements 

 as robert <unk> wrote in a review of ms. malcolm 's book mr. masson emerges as a <unk> <unk> and in the end a <unk> fool 

 but it is not <unk> malcolm who calls him such his own words reveal this psychological profile 

 we now know that the words were not always his own 

 there is one <unk> rule of journalism john <unk> has said 

 the writer must not <unk> 

 should the green light judges <unk> and hall have given to the fabrication of quotations become standard practice it will notably reduce the value of journalism for <unk> and for citizens 

 as judge <unk> put it to <unk> the right to deliberately <unk> what someone else has said is to <unk> the right to lie in print 

 masson has lost his case but the defendants and the profession to which they belong have lost far more 

 the historical profession will survive these decisions 

 perhaps in time the supreme court will correct them 

 but writing history is tough enough without judges <unk> throwing obstacles in the scholar 's path 

 mr. <unk> is albert <unk> professor of the <unk> at the city university of new york and a winner of <unk> prizes in history and <unk> 

 <unk> <unk> N years old senior vice president marketing at <unk> entertainment inc. was named president of capitol records inc. a unit of this entertainment concern 

 mr. <unk> succeeds david <unk> who resigned last month 

 legal <unk> in america have a way of assuming a <unk> significance far exceeding what is involved in the particular case 

 they speak volumes about the state of our society at a given moment 

 it has always been so 

 in the 1920s a young <unk> john t. <unk> <unk> to be a guinea <unk> in a test case sponsored by the american civil <unk> union to challenge a ban on the teaching of evolution imposed by the tennessee legislature 

 the result was a <unk> trial <unk> <unk> cultural conflicts in american life between the smart set whose spokesman was <unk> <unk> and the <unk> <unk> whom <unk> <unk> as <unk> <unk> 

 few now recall the actual outcome <unk> was convicted and fined $ N and his conviction was reversed on appeal because the fine was excessive under tennessee law 

 so it was with the <unk> case a generation later when <unk> <unk> became a <unk> rod for the <unk> of the cold war and <unk> attitudes toward the new deal he had served 

 his trials aroused public <unk> out of all proportion to the rather <unk> secrets he allegedly had passed to soviet intelligence 

 and so it seems to be with the case of elizabeth morgan the washington d.c. plastic surgeon jailed in a child custody case for refusing to reveal the <unk> of her daughter 

 dr. morgan has just emerged from the d.c. jail after more than two years ' <unk> for <unk> of court a <unk> to her many supporters 

 to the rest of us the case is a <unk> 

 it is what lawyers call fact intensive 

 it presents no great issue of legal principle no <unk> question of family law or the law of <unk> 

 instead it turns on the disputed and <unk> facts of who did what to whom 

 it is difficult if not impossible for anyone who has not <unk> over the thousands of pages of court <unk> and <unk> to have a <unk> opinion on the underlying merits of the controversy 

 certainly i do not 

 so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of the unusual power this case has <unk> over the minds of many not just in washington but elsewhere in the country and even the world 

 i suggest that three themes have come together in the strange case of dr. morgan 

 the first is that it represents an intense battle in what james <unk> used to <unk> as the war between the <unk> 

 but although <unk> did so gently and <unk> many of dr. morgan 's supporters have taken <unk> 's <unk> title the male animal quite literally 

 the <unk> of the <unk> aroused by the case <unk> to its <unk> importance in the war that <unk> accepted as an <unk> part of the human condition 

 a second theme is the <unk> of social class and race in the public reaction to the morgan case 

 dr. morgan is a highly educated white professional who attended some of the best schools 

 as members of the black <unk> in congress asked during the debate on the legislation that freed dr. morgan does anyone seriously believe that if she were an <unk> black <unk> woman congress would have rushed to pass a private relief bill <unk> her 

 or that the president would have <unk> to sign the bill out of <unk> for her plight 

 to ask those questions is to answer them 

 finally the case of dr. morgan gave congress an opportunity to act with <unk> <unk> and to engage in one of its favorite <unk> <unk> the district of columbia government 

 the local government is <unk> in the eyes of many residents for a variety of reasons and congressmen read the same newspapers and watch the same tv <unk> as other people in the area do 

 <unk> the d.c. government is <unk> for members of congress who do not have to answer to their own constituents for it 

 congress is <unk> from acting on such great issues of the day as the federal budget deficit 

 yet a bill tailored to the interests of a single individual passed congress with almost <unk> speed before the judicial process had run its course and indeed while the morgan case was awaiting a ruling by the appellate court 

 the morgan case thus tells us much more about the current state of sex class race and politics in our society than it does about the facts of dr. morgan 's particular situation 

 it may stand as a <unk> for how wide and deep the divisions in that society continue to be however we try to deny their existence

 the earnings drop at gm hughes electronics is a sign of tough times at both the defense operations of hughes aircraft co. and gm 's north american automotive operations which are a primary customer for the <unk> electronics corp. side of the gm hughes unit 

 profit at the unit fell to $ N million or N cents a share from $ N million or N cents a share largely because of a $ N million one-time charge associated with hughes 's previously announced plan to reduce employment by at least N people by year end 

 even excluding the charge however net fell N N 

 in addition gm 's north american vehicle production fell N N from a year ago which hurt <unk> electronic 's earnings a company spokesman said

 each of the four parties bidding for ps of new hampshire proposes a complex financial package to satisfy creditors and shareholders and also proposes a formula to limit rate increases to satisfy the state 

 the new round of bidding would seem to complicate the decision making for judge james <unk> the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case because the company 's stockholders unsecured creditors and regulators each are currently backing different plans 

 in addition some of the proposals are so close that <unk> issues such as timing may play a more important role 

 the unsecured creditors agreed in principle to support new haven <unk> united illuminating 's new bid
